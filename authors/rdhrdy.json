A lawyer and staunch [abolitionist](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Abolitionism), he had defended refugee slaves in court proceedings during the [antebellum](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Antebellum_South) years. \n\nThe [Republican Party](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Republican_Party_(United_States)) nominated Hayes as its [candidate for the presidency in 1876](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/1876_United_States_presidential_election), where he won through the [Compromise of 1877](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Compromise_of_1877) that officially ended [Reconstruction](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Reconstruction_Era)  by leaving the South to govern itself. In office he withdrew military  troops from the South, ending Army support for Republican state  governments in the South and for the efforts of African-American  freedmen to establish their families as free citizens. Hayes promoted [civil-service](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Civil_service) reform, and attempted to reconcile the divisions left over from the [Civil War](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/American_Civil_War) of 1861\u201365 and the Reconstruction Era of 1865\u201377. \n\nAn attorney in [Ohio](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ohio), Hayes served as city solicitor of [Cincinnati](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cincinnati) from 1858 to 1861. When the Civil War began, he left a fledgling political career to join the [Union Army](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Union_Army) as an officer. Hayes was wounded five times, most seriously at the [Battle of South Mountain](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Battle_of_South_Mountain) in 1862. He earned a reputation for bravery in combat and was promoted to the rank of [brevet](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Brevet_(military)) [major general](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Major_general). After the war, he served in Congress from 1865 to 1867 as a [Republican](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/History_of_the_Republican_Party_(United_States)).  Hayes left Congress to run for governor of Ohio and was elected to two  consecutive terms, from 1868 to 1872. Later he served a third two-year  term, from 1876 to 1877. \n\nIn 1876 the [Electoral College](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States_Electoral_College) made Hayes [president](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/1876_United_States_presidential_election) in one of the most contentious elections in U.S. history. He lost the popular vote to [Democrat](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/History_of_the_Democratic_Party_(United_States)) [Samuel J. Tilden](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Samuel_J._Tilden),  but won an intensely disputed electoral-college vote after a  Congressional commission awarded him 20 contested electoral votes. There  resulted the Compromise of 1877, in which the Democrats acquiesced to  Hayes's election on the condition that he withdraw remaining U.S. troops  protecting Republican officeholders in the South, thus officially  ending the Reconstruction era. \n\nHayes believed in [meritocratic](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Meritocracy)  government and in equal treatment without regard to wealth, social  standing or race. He ordered federal troops to guard federal buildings  and in doing so restored order during the [Great Railroad Strike of 1877](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Great_Railroad_Strike_of_1877).  Hayes implemented modest civil-service reforms that laid the groundwork  for further reform in the 1880s and 1890s. He vetoed the [Bland\u2013Allison Act](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bland%E2%80%93Allison_Act) (1878), which put silver money into circulation and raised nominal prices, insisting that maintenance of the [gold standard](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gold_standard) was essential to economic recovery. Hayes's policy toward Western Indians anticipated the assimilationist program of the [Dawes Act](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dawes_Act) of 1887. \n\nHayes kept his pledge not to run for reelection, retired to his  home in Ohio, and became an advocate of social and educational reform.  Biographer [Ari Hoogenboom](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ari_Hoogenboom)  said Hayes's greatest achievement was to restore popular faith in the  presidency and to reverse the deterioration of executive power that had  set in after [Abraham Lincoln's assassination](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Assassination_of_Abraham_Lincoln) in 1865.
