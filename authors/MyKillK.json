I'm finding it a lot more difficult and complicated than I thought...\n\nI've been able to get some simple components to serialize and deserialize correctly, but there are two areas I'm running into a lot of trouble. First, is saving an entire GameObject. Is it possible to do this directly, or do you have to loop through and serialize the individual components directly? The second issue I'm having are serializing game object \/ prefab \/ scriptable object \/ etc references. It's difficult because by default it wants to serialize separate copies of each reference, instead of create some kind of indirect indexed reference and serializing the index instead.\n\nAnyone have recommendations on properly saving &amp; loading game data, or assets (including paid ones) that does a good job at this without tons of changes to the code base?

You can't count on exactness, which makes for a real problem when comparing two floating-point numbers against each other.\n\nThe recommendation was to use the following formula for comparing equality of floating-point numbers v &amp; k.\n\nabs( v - k ) &lt;= (abs( v ) + abs( k ) + 1) * epsilon\n\nUsing this equation has already fixed two bugs in my game.
