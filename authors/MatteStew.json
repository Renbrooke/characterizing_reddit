There are two topics in the syllabus called Media and Information and Leadership and Governance. \n\nSome of the articles or examples that these topics are based on usually encircles American politics and media. However, most of these are usually taken from sources such as CNN, which often provides false narratives about American affairs. Because of this, the notes and resources that my school gives portray Trump undeservingly in a bad light. (E.g. Trump implying that there are good neo nazis after Charlottesville, Democrats always posed as victims of the nefarious Republicans and claiming Fox News as the harbringer of fake news)\n\nSo, do you pedes know any sites that has actual reliable and credible info about events going on in the US?
