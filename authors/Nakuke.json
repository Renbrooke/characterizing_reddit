is something that i'm real curious about because I have trouble understanding it not having grown up there. I say in general because I know if course everyone is different and different people do different things. I mean in general. \n\nI don't really buy into the meme that the majority of people don't bang and are basically robots. If we're going down that route the west has the same problem we just call them \"incels\". \n\nI grew up Hispanic so I grew up with a lot of hugging and kissing and everything; but for example my fiance's parents, according to her, don't hug or kiss or much of anything. They sleep in different rooms, etc. Yet the old lady always talks about how her husband needs this or that, if course cooks for him everyday; and my fiance told me she never saw her father be affectionate with her mother or say anything like I love you but he would bring them gifts when back from work and that's how he shows his care. My fiance is very affectionate with me although not in public and is to say to tell me she loves me around others including my family lol. I guess I am too though.  So she's pretty different from her parents. I don't know if that's due to my influence though. \n\nSome of our friends openly talk about their partner while others debt they have one at all even if we know. So they're in the reserved side but then in the media is contrasted. In anime (I know anime =\/= reality) it's coming to see characters crushing on others and trying to be affectionate, confessing etc etc. There's if course a whole general of  romance in both drama and anime and movies etc so obviously people like the idea of being romantic but debt it when it comes to their own situations. Even in the \"corner of the world movie\" which is more serious than the usual anime, set in the 40s there are scenes where the main characters are affectionate and kiss and it caught me by surprise because I wouldn't imagine that happened back then in Japan. \n\nI don't refer really to PDA because I know that's just rude in public but instead to how couples treat each other. Is it changing with younger generations? Will it continue to change? What have been your experiences or observations with this subject? ","1":"I'm mostly curious on whether most people follow one of the color schemes\/versions on the instructions or if it's more common to go for a custom paintjob (whether it's another historically accurate scheme or something completely original). If you look for your item schemes, where do you look for them? Is there like a database of WWI\/WWII tank or plane paint database? \n\nIt'd help me out in deciding what scheme to go for! :)","2":"","3":"","4":"Either their own national ensign or captured flags of the enemy?

There is and always will be a market for regular Joe's to sell things to other regular Joe's, especially used or unique items. eBay has the specialty, flea market aspect that Amazon doesn't and will never have. They're not in complete competition with them because they have something Amazon doesn't: a platform for people to buy and sell products that don't fit in a UPC-stamped blister pack. \n\nAnd yet they manage to fuck this up. They have obviously expended their resources and technological capabilities trying to turn themselves into a cheap knockoff Amazon and are completely killing their website. A large majority of sellers large and small, who have spent decades on eBay, who have extensive history there, have seen a TOTAL loss of sales. Zero views, zero watchers, zero sales. It's the website equivalent of a stolen iPhone - nothing more than a useless brick you can use as a paperweight. \n\nIf sellers aren't selling, buyers also aren't buying. Many can't find what they're looking for because the search engine is soon damn illogical. People will type search terms and get results for a completely different thing. They can't find items and sellers they previously bought from. Buyers and sellers alike have reported to be essentially shadowbanned and unable to communicate or perform transactions. \n\nThe IT department and CEO oof eBay should be fired for their outright incompetence I'm running of this company. It is straight up embarrassing how terrible this website has become in the span of 4 months. And nothing is being done about it. I would not be surprised to see this company obsolete in only a few years. \n\nThe only ones who lose are the consumers who will be left without a place to buy and sell unique or casual items to each other in an auction format. You'll have to suck to Craiglist it fb marketplace it other local classifieds until another whose like way comes along. Which it probably won't because the goal is not to make good websites anymore, it's to keep up with the silicon valley Jones family known as Amazon. \n\nI'm not even a large selection on eBay. I don't usually pay now than like 100 items a month and don't rely on it for my livelihood but this level of incompetence and stupidity in people who are supposed to be able to run a company pisses me off. The senior guy in charge of freaking product management has a *theater arts* degree and is to much of a shill to answer why sales have plummeted in a couple months and a goddamn view counter doesn't work.  Hire some businessmen and systems technician to run your technology company, not Shakespeareans! \n\n\/Rant","6":"I'm posting this for my fiance as she doesn't use Reddit. She's a 160 cm tall, 65kg,  25 year old Japanese woman and since she stopped working has become quite more sedentary and gained about 20 lbs. She hasn't really had a problem with being overweight but I guess the mix of her diet ( lots of noodles and ice cream) and being sedentary caught up.\n\nShe wants to lose 20 lbs and is doing exercising 3 times a week at the gym, with a limited trainer program. I don't really think she needs to count calories as she eats pretty healthy and doesn't eat big portions but I put her stats into the tdee calculator and it gave me 1100 calories for a 500 calorie deficit cut. I feel like that is really low. I'm cutting to trying to lose 20 lbs and got a 1400 calories cut result. I'm about the same height and 160 lbs. Is this is correct number? I don't want her to starve or obsess over this. I want her to continue exercising and eating healthy at a deficit lol of what do you all think?

We may or may not (probably not) be living in Japan at the time of their death. (However if we inherit the house it'd be very likely we move to Japan as the largest expense is taken care and hopefully by then I already have a pension from my career in the USA). Question is how much we'll have to pony up once the in laws pass on. On a quick google search I saw the property tax is between 1.4 - 2.1% with 1\/3 of the value exempted. Whether that value is based on value at purchase or current value determined by an appraiser is unknown to me still. I also have no idea of the value of the house and land. \n\nThen I read about a 55% inheritance tax which blows my mind. So if the house is worth 300k USD we'll have to send the gov a check for 150k?? That's pretty insane. Then again I have no idea what I'm doing so that's why I am asking here.\n\nIf any people here have gone through inheritance I'd appreciate the advice.","11":"Hello I know this has been discussed a million times but if like to see for advice on what you would do in my situation. \n\nBackground: Half assed 1 year of Japanese at my University using genki 1. Later on I meet my now fiance and while dating started to catch in to a good amount of everyday phrases and words just from talking to her. We have spoken 2\/3 English 1\/3 Japanese for about 3 years and I've improved a lot in listening and speaking but I'm lagging on vocab and Reading writing.\n\nI got serious about working to master Japanese about one year ago and decided to do rtk and learn all joyo kanji. Then restart genki and start learning vocab with the kanji I learned. \n\nI'm at 800 kanji now and have plateaued hard. I feel like I'm having to remember a thousand random stories and if I take a week off I have to go back a couple hundred and go at it again to remember the previous kanji that make the more complex ones . I don't know how long it will take me to learn the rest and I keep reviewing until they ones I've started are down solid. \n\nAs you all know this doesn't actually teach me any Japanese. I've been able to guess the meaning of some words using the kanji I've learned but not many and it seems I'm just learning kanji for the fuck of it with no practicality. I like kanji as I enjoy calligraphy but of course learning all 2k separately isn't necessary for that.\n\nOn my recent trip to Japan I was able to identify a lot of kanji but only individually so it served me little purpose as there was 4 or 5 more kanji that I didn't recognize. \n\nHowever I was able to pick up on a couple of common kanji just by having them explained to me by my fiance when I asked about a word or name and I now have them down solid. Same thing with some manga I brought back, just reading for about a month I've learned a good amount of words and the kanji within them just by reading and using a dictionary with words I didn't recognize. Now I can read them easily.\n\nWhich brings me to whether I should stop RTK , start genki and start learning real vocab. Rtk has helped me to be able to differentiate kanji , notice radicals and for handwriting. My fiance even said I am better at noticing the small details in kanji and writing them than she is. She has to use the keyboard for certain kanji.\n\nWhat would you all advise?\n\nTldr : plateaued in rtk, should I drop it and start doing genki with kanji?","12":"I hope this doesn't sound as cheesy as I think it will but I just wanted to say to everyone to please be careful about drinking; and developing what you may not realize is a habit of drinking. I know more fellow members than I am comfortable with who are unhealthy in how much alcohol they drink. They don't even realize or accept its become a habit for them. Some of them drink because they're bored and need to pass the time on liberty; maybe they thought it was cool to do at first and now its just part of their routine. Others drink to shut out the bullshit and troubles from their ship or unit.\n\nI don't really drink at all and I don't enjoy being buzzed so I don't understand the appeal well; but please be aware of when drinking turns from something you do to enjoy the taste or have a fun night to something you need to keep you going or make your forget. \n\nAnd if its gotten to that point, please do what is needed to alleviate the issue. Its corny but it breaks my heart to see people I care about try to drown out their sorrows . Hope everyone is having a good night (or day for our overseas members)","13":"No issues, paid on time.

A little more than 2 years ago I made this thread: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/japan\/comments\/41makd\/girlfriend_wont_tell_her_parents_about_our\/ where I got some good advice regarding why my fiance wouldn't tell her parents about me (I didn't know until then that her behavior was normal), and I'm happy to say it's gone very well despite expected ups and downs. I was going to post in japanlife but I don't live in Japan and don't want to break the rules.\n\nAnyways I'm not here to blog about my life or anything, I'm back for some advice. I proposed last year and my fiance was very happy that I did. We've spoken quite a lot about the practical and logistical concerns of being married especially in regards to moving and living overseas. The last \"hurdle\" we're facing is the actual \u7d50\u5a5a\u306e\u6328\u62f6 \u3002So I'm just looking for advice or experiences from men or women that have married and already went through it. Of course I've asked my fiance as well, this is just supplementary.\n\nThe parents already know about us; last year I sent some gifts for them which they refused and then they sort of ignored the situation for about a year. They were nooot happy. Not a very positive event but we moved on through it. The father stays quiet on the issue and the mother has let it be known she's unhappy about the idea of her marrying and moving away.\n\nNow we're waiting on the fiance visa etc and since I'm visiting this month my fiance arranged for us to visit them and stay at their house a couple days as part of the trip. I have no idea what I'm doing, how to act, what to say etc. My fiance told me to get a blazer and shirt for it etc. I bought some good wine to gift them although the father doesn't drink, some simple omiyage for them and the rest of the family. I've been studying mostly kanji and my Japanese has improved a lot but I am sure I won't be able to be fluent at this meeting lol.\n\nAny advice at this point would be helpful for me; should I try to speak the Japanese I do know or will I look like a idiot and just stick to English with her translating? Should I go all-in with the seiza and \u5a18\u3055\u3093\u3092\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044 or ask as I would to an American parent? What questions will they probably ask? Am I going to get berated?

A couple days ago a user by the name of ichigokurosaki015 made a thread offering to hire someone to perform Japanese to English translations of what ended up being some sappy fanart from the Kimetsu no Yaiba series. \n\nhttps:\/\/i.imgur.com\/TudupCS.png\n\nThe user took the conversation to messenger (posted below with PII removed)\n\nhttps:\/\/i.imgur.com\/yx7AWq7.jpg\n\nThey basically agreed to pay 4 dollars a page of fanart that was translated, and I made sure to let them know I'd require payment before sending the translated work back, to which they agreed. They were pretty pushy about getting the work quickly which should have thrown up red flags but I thought it was just cultural or something. After doing most of the work I offered to send them what had been completed after receiving payment and they started to be all sketchy about getting the file with the entire translation first before payment, offering to pay extra for \"my hard work\", and giving an ultimatum to either send the file or \"waste your time\" - all telltale signs of an amateur scammer. To give the benefit of the doubt I sent a sample file with only bits and pieces of translated text which they earlier agreed to accept as proof of translation but then continued to refuse ot provide payment. I lost some time of work and got some practice down so no big deal but this is my fault for not requiring payment up front.\n\nI did a little digging and what I found is super weird, seems to be just a unhealthily obsessed fangirl though its possible it may be someone actually trying to scam money out of people. The user's facebook was a member of various Kimetsu no Yaiba fanart pages such as \n\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Kimetsu-no-yaiba-Ships-103806181175353\n\nand \n\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Giyu-x-Shinobu-102346201261625\n\nWhich contain paypal.me links I guess asking for donations for their \"translation work\" The paypal.me link has an username similar to the ichigokurosaki username of the user whom made the offer post (deleted now), posted below with PII removed:\n\nhttps:\/\/i.imgur.com\/HCg23Fj.png\n\nThe page owner also has a youtube account that just posts these same fanart comics in video form and does text stories between the characters. It's some really weird stuff and I'm a weeb myself. The pages are owned by someone with an email containing \"villamia\" which coincides with another user spamming frequent translation requests of Kimetsu no Yaiba fanart here on \/r\/translator , \/u\/gvillamia ; whom deleted most of their request history after the conversation I had with the person who yipped me:\n\nhttps:\/\/i.imgur.com\/bczjpr0.png\n\nI confronted the person on facebook about all this stuff and told them it's pretty petty to be trying to scam people out of their work and waste their time for some sappy fanart which had them denying any connection to the gvillamia user. Eventually though they contradicted themselves and ended the messenger conversation saying that they had \"hacked\" the facebook, reddit and paypal account of the gvillamia user and it was a shame they didn't have money in the account. They then said I'm the second person they tried to scam. I think this is a sad attempt at a bluff but just in case I've reported the situation to Paypal and Facebook for their review. \n\nTL;DR : Beware of some Kimetsu no Yaiba fangirl offering to pay for translations - you'll get yipped as I did.

Thanks in advance","58":"Good Morning.\n\nI wanted to see if we could have a discussion on this topic as I'm still pretty new to this topic. When I was at a station and did non-rate evaluations we were told to make a Word document and \"write what you want to get (1 to 7) and why\". \n\nI thought it was interesting that I would be requested to tell the command what score I want as it would be most beneficial to me to receive all 7's of course. Wouldn't make sense to request anything lower. Of course in practice 7 in every category may not be warranted. But you would still ask for it. I understand why they ask support though so it can help supervisors to jog their memory of tasks you have performed and achievements you have completed to give you a proper score. However they wanted me to write as much as possible since I was told that anything that isn't on there wouldn't be considered. So I would write paragraphs for each category. In essence, I was doing my supervisor's job for them. I just thought it was structured strangely.\n\nWhenever I got my completed evaluation I would receive mostly 5 and 6 an maybe a 7 in one category and one 4.  I would be told I'm doing good, etc etc meeting over.\n\nThen I got to A school and during ALP found out there is much more to the system than I knew. Found out that there is sort of a structure of how supporting evidence is supposed to be written. Also found out that evaluators are not supposed to request members to score themselves or to provide total support for every category - the evaluator should take the supporting remarks in mind while making their own impartial judgment of what scores the member earned. It is their responsibility to observe the member through the marking period and using the supporting remarks have a well-rounded image of how the member performed and mark them off of that. I also found out you can dispute the marks you receive through a formal process.\n\nAs for quality control, at my first unit I remember our newest member, a very popular-with-command SN show us her first set of EER's and have my mind blown that she received about four 7's with the rest 6 and 5. She had a couple months of TIS and a watch qual and a 45 qual. Compared to myself with 3 years TIS with watch, 2 boat crew quals, engineer, BTM, tactical bow gunner and as lead FN. So obviously quality control was not a big thing in EER's. However recently I learned that the new system requires evaluators to enter a small comment for any score below a 4 or any 7. Apparently this gets reviewed somewhere higher up although who knows to what extent. Hopefully this is actually helping to make the system more impartial. \n\nAt my current unit I have been mostly in training mode since arrival as I am breaking in to the standard MST qualifications. As we all know though just because you don't have the qual letter doesn't mean you aren't doing the entirety of the qualification as if you already had it so I intend to use the work I've done as a break-in the same as if I were formally qualified. Being in the IMD MISLE is the grand majority of my daily work and I intended to include some stats on the quantity of MISLE I have completed as part of my support. (E.g. Numbe rof activities completed, number of enforcement actions processed, etc) However I was informed that our Chief considers that \"just doing your job\" and not something you can use for EER's.\n\nIn other words if it has to do with the work I do on a daily basis, such as MISLE work, the quantity of response cases I sortied on, processing enforcement, etc. It can't be used because its \"just doing your job\". Is this how its supposed to work. I understand that it doesn't warrant a 7 but isn't \"our job\" what we are getting evaluated on? If not then what is being evaluated? It seems from talking to others at the unit that what is being looked for in reviews is extracurricular stuff like volunteering, membership in things like CGEA or the morale committee, etc. Things that are great as an addition to a solid performance of assigned duties but that don't actually contribute to the mission we are working to achieve. I am just trying to understand if this is a common line of thought or not and whether I need to start hitting harder on those aspects prior to the end of the marking period. \n\nLastly for recommendation to advancement - obviously there is recommended, not recommended and now, \"not ready\". The latter is meant to be used when RPQ's and EPQ's are not yet completed or not enough sea time or not all qualifications required for advancement have yet been completed. The story is that marking won't hurt you however do you all think to certain eyes it may be seen as equal to a \"not recommended\". It will be interesting to see how the new system develops in this aspect.","59":"My wife and I lived back in California where we had Tricare West for our insurance (HealthNet Federal). She had a test done in June of 2019 at Quest where she had other tests done before and always had them successfully paid by Tricare. No issues.\n\nWe receive orders to the east coast and move from there and forward our mail. We receive a letter from Quest billing her for $300 for the test because \"Insurance rejected the claim because member was not found in system\". \n\nFirst thing we notice is her name is spelled incorrectly with 3 letters off in the last name and 1 off in the first name. This is why Tricare rejected the claim. Since we moved to the east coast, we switched to Tricare East which is Humana Military - technically a different company. \n\nWe called Quest and fixed the information and told them to submit a claim to Tricare East with the correct information. Months later we receive a second notice with the same bill and corrected name. No mention of a claim just a bill. We call and are told that no effort to bill the insurance was made, we just need to pay. I told them to submit a claim to the insurance so they can receive payment. Months later another third notice with bigger scarier font and the usual \"do not ignore this notice\" etc spiel. We sent an email to them on the website and received a confirmation email that it was received but they decided not to write back. No response from their Facebook page either.\n\nNot sure where to go from here. In the past in billing or collection disputes I dealt with for my father I always communicated via certified mail and sometimes email. I would like to send Quest a letter via certified mail but am unsure of where to send it to since they don't have a correspondence address. Just a PO box where to remit payment. \n\nI am also not sure if there is an office specifically in California which regulates medical billing to which I could write to and hopefully get Quest to stop ignoring the communications we are sending. Is there such an agency?","60":"Due to circumstances I missed most of the 2016 election year in terms of keeping up to date with events, debates, developments etc. Voted for Trump as I couldn't stand Hillary and I couldn't have made a better decision!\n\nNow I want to be sure I'm part of this coming year on our way to reelection.

I still think it's blown way out of proportion and does kids more harm than good in certain cases - certainly in mine.\n\nBefore our 2 week old daughter was born I read a lot about everything havin to do with the pregnancy, the baby etc. My wife is Japanese born and raised, I am Colombian born, U.S. raised - in summary there's a mix of culture and parenting styles in the home. As I read in all the posters and the bulletins etc I told my wife - baby must sleep on a flat hard surface, no blankets, no pillows, no beanies, no cosleeping, no bedsharing, no looking at the baby, no thinking about the baby \/s . \n\nMy wife was a little surprised as in Japan its the common thing to bedshare with children from infancy to almost preteen age. Apparently she slept between my in laws until age 10 (which blows my mind - but its their home). In Japan most kids sleep with parents until about age 3 or 4 and do so from day one back home. No cosleeper or anything, just between the pillows or on top of the chest or whatever. At the hospital, the baby is placed in their bassinet with a beanie, a couple blankets and two piece clothes. Keep in mind Japan has a much lower rate of SIDS and infant death in general than the U.S. \n\nI am very sure that my daughter suffers from some significant reflux. She was fine the first couple days while in the hospital and after coming home - but since about day 4 or 5 she's had a lot of trouble after feeding. Yes, she is burped. She lets out some loud ones. When burping her, she arches her back and throws her head back whilst making a noise like she's \"clearing her throat\" (like when adults clear their throat of mucus). She'll stop eating half way sometimes to work through the gas and continue eating 10 minutes later. She usually feels sleepy after feeding of course, so being good parents we lay her down to sleep on her bassinet. Literally 30 seconds to 3 minutes later she begins making gutteral noises. Her breathing is rapid like after you run a lap (that might just be a normal baby thing), she sounds like she's wheezing , having something come back up. A couple times I've seen her literally burp and wheeze, groan and have milk drool out of her mouth and it causes her a lot of discomfort. This of course causes her to cry. You pick her up and she does a little better.\n\nShe falls asleep in seconds if you lay her belly down on my chest even right after eating. No issues. I'll have her like this 15 or 20 minutes; as soon as you put her on her back, a couple minutes later she starts to choke up again. \n\nIts getting to the point now where she refuses to sleep on her back. Excepting some cases when she's in very deep sleep after sleeping on my chest a long time (hours), she will fuss and cry and kick and punch around if she's placed to sleep on her back. Thinking it may be she doesn't like her bassinet, we tried on our bed supervised and same thing. \n\nHere's where she DOES sleep: Propped up on her boppy, in her car seat (can sleep there for hours like when we drove about 5 hours away), on my chest, on a flat surface on stomach.\n\nI am starting to lean strongly towards just letting the poor girl sleep comfortably on her belly. But according to all the \"experts\" that's like a death sentence. Ok. So what about on the boppy? Nope that can apparently kill her. Ok. Prop her up on her side with positioning blocks they sell on amazon. Nope that can kill her too. In the car seat for naps. Definitely don't do that, that cna kill her to. On my chest, nope that can kill her if I smush her. Rock and play? NO THOSE WERE RECALLED IT'LL KILL HER TOO.\n\nI want to be responsible and keep my child safe but it seems the only Doctor approved^TM way to do that is to place her on a flat surface naked within a bubble inside of an isolation chamber. And when you look at the \"stats\" for many of these infant death cases it seems many of them had external factors that logically aren't conducive to the well being of a child. Parents are on drugs or alcoholic or someone's smoking in the room, or their dad is 500 lbs with sleep apnea and smushed them. But they just \"happened\" to be sleeping in product X or Y or on their stomach. I wonder how many infants that sleep exactly as mandated by safe sleep guidelines die. I'm sure they do. \n\nSo what are parents to do? Constantly all we see are news stories about how this and that cna kill your baby, this and that rises the risk of SIDS, . When you ask doctors for advice they only parrot what I already read on the AAP website - no real world advice. I want my child to sleep comfortably, not have acid running up her throat and mom and dad to maintain sanity. When I ask my parents for advice they say I'm listening too much to public health blanket warnings. My first photo of me in the NICU as a kid was sleeping on my stomach. I slept on my stomach.My wife slept on her stomach. My uncles and aunts - a total of 10 on my father's side and 12 on my mother's (yes they had that many kids) slept on their stomach and none of them died as infants. \n\nMy wife sees where I'm coming from but is hesitant to try sleeping on the stomach because of all the warning plastered everywhere and I can't blame her. I respect her decision and continue to put her on her back but it sucks to see the baby suffer.\n\nAs for the pediatrician - she says reflux is normal etc - told me to put a wedge or some towels under the mattress which I did (what happened to flat surface?) - make sure you burp her. Hold her upright for 20 minutes (not easy to do when the baby's trying to sleep right after eating), it's ok she's fine; she's so big and heavy and thriving and so awake everything is perfect tee hee *googly eyes* . She told me \"how do you even know if she has reflux?\" So that's about as far as that went. I'd take her to another doctor to push for possible antacids but my wife gets mad and says I'm making a mountain out of a molehill.","68":"In the past when I've had to go somewhere on orders I've simply called ADTRAV and they found me a flight to charge to get central billing account.

We were a little conservative with the formula as we were following the rules the hospital gave us about up to 2 oz per feeding every three hours. But she seems to want more which finally calmed her. Seems she was just hungry. \n\nShe went to bed and was calm and sleeping until she started to make burping noises and complaining a little. She would wake up when she had a big gas and some milk would come up. She would be calm in certain positions on my arm, but not flat. I placed her on the car seat and swung her a little back and forth after which she let out a lot of gas from both ends, and that was that, she went back to sleep for a while. I elevated her head and upper back a little bit by inclining the mattress a couple degrees which seemed to avoid reflux.\n\nNow my wife has woken up and worked her magic, she's relaxed with her; but I feel like I'm just not burping right or something causing her issues.\n\nI'm just super tired and haven't been able to sleep at all.

The bill is still available for vote tomorrow in the senate. The administration has indicated that President Trump would sign the resolution assuming the senate passes it. \n\nThis thread is for discussion of this situation, what the likely response will be from headquarters, what we can do to prepare, what we can do to increase awareness of this situation, and what actions are being taken in the federal government to mitigate this situation from happening in the future to the Coast Guard.\n\nI am unaware if the DoD currently has approved funding that is unaffected in the event of a lapse in appropriations as it did in January of 2019. \n\nCurrently there are four acts which propose continuing appropriations to the Coast Guard in the event of a lapse:\n\n1. S.21 Pay our Coast Guard Act (https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/bill\/116th-congress\/senate-bill\/21)\n\n2. H.R.350 - Pay Our Coast Guard Act of 2019 (https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/bill\/116th-congress\/house-bill\/350)\n\n3. H.R.367 - Pay Our Coast Guard Parity Act of 2019 (https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/bill\/116th-congress\/house-bill\/367)\n\n4. H.R.421 - Making continuing appropriations for the Coast Guard. (https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/bill\/116th-congress\/house-bill\/421)\n\nSo far none of these have passed the initial house of congress where they are proposed. \n\nAssuming tomorrow's bill does not pass and a lapse occurs on Friday; I guess our final payment until appropriations are decided on by Congress will be on 11\/30\/2019 . Assuming it does pass, the government will not lapse until 12\/22\/2019 which I would then guess our final payment would be on 12\/31\/2019 . \n\nDo you think financial institutions whom serve primarily military will once again provide assistance to us? In the most recent shutdown, Sea West Credit Union and Navy Federal were both providing interest-free loans up to the amount of one pay period with proof of previous income. CG SUPRT was offering limited loans to members under HSWL, and was unable to offer more loans after some days. In the previous shutdown, HQ used a part of the operations budget to provide members with one more payment even after appropriations had lapsed. It is uncertain if this will happen again. \n\nMany local communities, food pantries, and enlisted associations, officer's associations and Chief Petty Officer Associations provided assistance in the form of food, diapers, household items etc. \n\nIf you find yourself in a tough spot, know that it is possible (in all circumstances, not only a shutdown) to contact utilities, lenders, banks, and other institutions to request a deferment of payments for a limited amount of time. Whatever you do, make sure it gets communicated to you in writing to avoid possibly becoming delinquent on payments and affecting your credit. Do not take someone's word without written confirmation from an official source. \n\nLastly, although servicemembers are required to follow all Coast Guard policy in regards to political activities (refer to Military Civil and Dependent Affairs, COMDTINST M1700.1 CHAPTER 1.C.) ; friends and family are within their right to voice their thoughts on the situation in both official and unofficial channels - however remind them to refrain from making statements which could be construed as being made in an official capacity from your position as a military member. The two best actions that can be taken by loved ones who wish to help the situation contacting their federal representatives in the legislative branch and the administration; and spreading awareness of the facts both on social media and to the mass media. \n\nOut greatest enemy as a service is unawareness. Much of the public does not know who we are or what we do, what we as a service contribute to the nation, the public, the environment, to international commerce, and safety of navigation. Many people, not of their own fault, assume that the Coast Guard is something along the lines of Baywatch. This is our fault and only our own as the service has historically done a poor job of marketing itself and its contributions and needs due to a misplaced sense of humility. With all respect to our brothers and sisters in arms, we are not the ones on the news raiding a hidden compound in the middle east, we are not the ones on the news refueling a jet in mid-air, we are not the ones on the news sailing a giant aircraft carrier to remind enemies abroad of our capability. But we do an unmeasurable amount of work each and every single day \nat home and abroad, with the least resources and people. Be proud of what you do. Even if you think you're just dome guy scrubbing a bilge, your work and your sacrifice and that of your dependents has value. We deserve support from our leaders and our government and deserve to be assured that our families will be taken care of at all times that we are in service to the nation. Don't sell yourself short - I will be contacting my federal representatives as a citizen and a servicemember and imploring their speedy mitigation of this issue now and in the future - and I hope you can do the same.","72":"I wanted to set up an allotment to send some savings over to a secondary checking account I have.

Fuck this rental market.","76":"My parents immigrated to this country 16 years ago and since that day have busted their ass working nonstop. My father has been working every day of the week without a break for the past 3 and a half years. My mother cleans a big mansion twice a week which takes her about 8 hours to do each time. \n\nThey bought their home with their work, then 2008 rolled around and one of the biggest scams in this country's history robbed them of their home. They had bought the house at the peak of the artificial bubble created by realtors who will do whatever to line their pockets.\n\n12 years later they have paid over $200,000 in rent. They sitll don't own a home and every time they need to move to another place, they had to suck the dick of every property manager and realtor that they have the displeasure of meeting to even be considered worthy of a goddamn $1500 apartment. Apparently unless someone makes $6,000 or above, they will be unable to afford paying $1500 in rent. Why the fuck would someone making that much money rent your cramped apartment? Reading a property listing is like getting chastised and warned that you better not waste the realtor's time with anything less than absolute perfection. $75 dollar application fee per person, $100 application fee for the HOA per person, $350 non refundable fee for the cat, 2 month's deposit, first month's rent. Must include three years of tax returns, 6 paystubs, a letter from your employer. No paystubs because you don't work a traditional hourly wage job? Sorry you're fucked we can't accept bank statements, photocopies of checks or photocopies of the receipts for rent payment for the last 2 years where you paid $1700 a month. You have a pension from your country of origin for your military service? Sorry that's not acceptable its not a paystub and its foreign so go fuck yourself. Also don't forget you need 2 personal references, your last 4 landlords, and you need to sign this contract where you agree that anything and everything that could very possibly happen is your fault and you are liable to pay a fee codified as \"extra rent\" for those things.\n\nIf you're feeling a little schlonged, just read Florida tenant protections laws. Oh never mind, those don't exist. It's actually legal to charge a $500 dollar non refundable application fee because no law prohibits it. \n\nLastly, your son is willing to act as a guarantor for you with his income from the military? Sorry that's not going to work out its too risky.\n\nRealtors, in general are in my experience the most stupid group of people I have ever met. I have NEVER met a realtor or property manager that posses logic, common sense, or critical thinking skills. In their world nothing outside of someone working at Fortune 500 company for a set salary of $2,000 a week exists. Ironically enough they themselves do not make a set salary and would have to reject themselves if they ever applied to rent one of their properties. Fuck realtors.","77":"https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/Kxg65Xg\n\nThere has been a small leak in the house in one of the windowsills since I moved in. Nothing really that concerns me since it's just a minute leak. The landlord sent his Carpenter to take a look at it whom reported back that the shingles and roof wood was rotted and must be replaced. \n\nI have a baby due this month so the landlord wanted to get the work done before the birth. According to him it would be a 4 day job. I'm in the military and am at work will they are there and some days am on duty the entire day and night so my wife, a recent immigrant, stays at home.\n\nWork started and it looks like they pulled off all the shingles and rotted wood. The next morning a man knocked on the door from the city building department and told my wife that the contractor did not have a permit to perform the repair\/construction and must stop. The contractor was not there at the time.  I can't give much more details as my wife didn't ask more questions. The man left his business card and posted a sign on the door ordering to stop work and declaring it illegal to remove the sign. \n\nI took a quick look at the Connecticut building code and it seems like all work does require a permit excepting if the roof repair is less than 25% (it's about 50%).\n\nI spoken to the contractor whom said he didn't know what was going on and he'd figure it out. I spoke to the landlord whom did not know a permit was required for the repair however he said that the contractors should know. he said he could speak to somebody that he knows at the building department and thanked me for the information. Been in the dark since then.\n\nI looked up the contractor on both the business search for the state and the license search and could find nothing in either one. I can also not find any website for the contractor. It seems that they are not licensed and I assume possibly not insured either.\n\nI'm not sure what what happened at this point, my only concern is now that the shingles and all that have been removed, water getting into the building as it will rain later in the week; or my natural gas bill going through the roof if there are now drafts caused by the construction. (We're below freezing for the next week) .\n\nShould I contact my renter's insurance (USAA)?","78":"https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/a5ZAtv8\n\nSo I'm renting this house in Connecticut and I'm trying to figure out how the heating system works. Landlord goes overseas in the winter and doesn't really care about much anyways.  He did say it's a hot water system, not steam. Uses natural gas and has one radiator in the finished part of the basement and a couple on the ground floor. \n\nI just turned it on a couple of days ago. The first 4  days the gas usage went up a little from 0.5 ccf per day to about 3 ccf per day. However yesterday it went nuts somehow and apparently the usage yesterday was 8 ccf. Yesterday alone I spent about 16 dollars in gas. The temperature yesterday dropped to about 32 f at night. I have set it at 66 f on the thermostat but I don't know if that might be too high. \n\nAlso I had closed the valve for the downstairs pipe thinking it was the out pipe but it was actually the return pipe. It was going to the basement and not returning to the boiler to close the system , which I think may have messed with it so I've opened that valve back up. \n\nThe white rqdiayrs feel warm but not \"hot\". Especially not as hot as the pipes coming in and out of the boiler. Those are boiling hot, can barely touch them. But the heat exchanger in the radiators, pipes going into the radiators and radiators themselves are just warm.  Ican't imagine the system is really so inneficient to require 8 ccf of gas a day. \n\nWould placing insulation foam around the pipes like that in the photos help? Are the radiator supposed to get more hot and the same temperature at the pipes next to the boiler? And would it possibly be more efficient and cheaper to use an electric space heater in the room in in than using this system?","79":"https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/a5ZAtv8\n\nSo I'm renting this house in Connecticut and I'm trying to figure out how the heating system works.

I hope that it can possibly save other from going through the headache. Go with Amazon or Target IMO\n\n\n&gt;I am absolutely disappointed with the appalling customer service from Buy Buy Baby\/Bed Bath and Beyond. This company is incapable of doing the most simple thing a company can do - sell a product and deliver it. I fail to understand how it is possible for someone to order a product from Amazon and receive it 2 days later with no headache, yet BBB have been not been able to send a product in over 3 weeks. I have had THREE orders cancelled for absolutely NO REASON and the worst part is that when I call to inquire WHY the order is cancelled, the answer is \"there is no details, we don't know why it was cancelled\".\n\n\n&gt;The first order (BAB3572888295) was made on September 15th on my wife's account. We paid with an American Express Platinum card with no credit limit. There was no issue and has not been any issue with the credit card or payment. We also used a $50 gift card gifted to us on our registry. 1 week later we check the order status and noticed it said \"cancelled\"; no email or notice of cancellation. I called expecting a simple fix and instead was told the order was cancelled, there is no way to reactivate it. I was advised to reorder but of course I needed to get back the $50 dollar gift card that was charged in the cancelled order and did not have its funds returned. I was transferred to a supervisor who gave long winded lip service about how he's so sorry and how he understands it's a \"difficult time\" expecting a child, etc etc. PROMISING me that he would resolve the issue and call me back or write a couple days later. Then he disappeared and never contacted again even after we sent him an email asking him the status. His email is attached below.\n\n\n&gt;I call again days later and in a demonstration of the only competency at your company, the customer service representative I spoke to was able to send a new gift card which took a week to arrive. On September 30th, I make an order once again (BAB3575741150) with the new gift card. To my surprise, it was once again cancelled 2 days later.\n\n\n&gt;I call back again yesterday, October 3rd, to ask WHY the order was cancelled ; again the explanation is \"we don't know\", I was transferred to a department which explained that their \"Smart system\" (the representative's own words) for some reason flagged the order and needed to be cleared or the same thing would keep happening she confirmed my information by asking me my email address and shipping address and stated that it would not happen again. I was then transferred back to sales to reorder the stroller. The representative at first charged me the amount without the $50 gift card applied and when I told her I needed the $50 gift card applied since the second cancelled order spent the funds. After being on hold 10 minutes she finalized the third order (BAS3576148251), charged my card once again (it currently has 2 pending holds of $460 due to these orders) and told me it would be shipped expedited.\n\n\n&gt;That was yesterday at 12 PM noon; I checked the BBB app just in case at 1:00 PM and guess what? The THIRD order has been cancelled ONCE AGAIN.\n\n\n&gt;How is your system so faulty? I am attempting to pay you $460 dollars and our friend has already paid you $50 for a product and yet the company continues to cancel orders. This is absolutely ridiculous. I had to call once again to reinstate the gift card balance and then drive one hour each way to the nearest retail store to buy this stroller only because we are close enough to the due date that having a stroller and car seat is a matter of safety and we didn't want the gift card to go to waste. I will NEVER purchase another item from any Bed Bath and Beyond owned business again. I will be spreading this story to all my friends and family, coworkers, acquaintances, the Chicco company, and sharing it on social media so that people can understand just why it is that your stock keeps plummeting to the ground - because of terrible customer service. I will also be sure to send this in a letter to officers of the Bed Bath and Beyond corporation to see if maybe THEY also get a clue why their business is failing.\nExtremely disappointing.\n\nAnyone else here that has had a similar experience with this company?","84":"Good afternoon,\n\nI'm in a bit of a pickle and need all the help I can get.\n\nToday my car broke down.

Then he said (racism warning) \"I don't know if these n*gg*rs (movers were black)  know or not but you should know I own the driveway and I let you all use it. Just so you know. I was shocked and just said again if he needs I can move the truck so he can get out.\n\nHe said he wanted it it off the way the whole time which is impossible and after some back and forth said \"ok your banned from using the driveway now!\"  Then he went back in. We finished the move and nothing from him since then. We put our cars in the parking spaces through the driveway anyways as as far as I know the guy is out if his mind.\n\nI looked up the property parcel records and the houses are over 100 years old. Current owner had owned since 2006 and presumably the driveway has been in use since at least then. I think it should qualify for a prescribed easement even if the guy actually owns the driveway as it has been over 15 years since it's been shared. \n\nI talked to the landlord and he said I should probably just bit use the driveway anymore. But there is no other way to get to the parking in the back of the house. I have no place to park my cars if I can't use the driveway. If this actually becomes an issue where I can't use the driveway would this be cause to break the lease? The property was advertised with parking and it was assumed I could use both the driveway and the parking. But again nothing is specifically worth in the lease mentioning either. \n\nI appreciate your help with this.","108":"If I purchased a set of tires form Costco, and am no longer a member, am I still covered by the Costco Road Hazard Warranty if something covered by the warranty happens to the tires?

Some background info:\n\n- Enlisted in the Military, budget above\n- Recently married one child on the way (why we want to get something bigger)\n- Currently have a financed Altima 2006 which I paid way too much for. Seems like every day it has a new issue. Recently replaced the struts just due to age and may need to replace rear shocks and front control arms. The gas gauge is messed up and replacing the fuel pump didn't fix it. Sometimes the engine has misfire and I believe it may just be the ignition coil which I'll replace. Drive belt squeaks with A\/C on. Now the lock on the driver side is giving me trouble and the transmission is sounding weird. I keep up on maintenance but it keeps giving me problems.\n\nMy income is above; wife is currently not working as she just recently immigrated from overseas and is awaiting work permit and due to pregnancy. \n\nDebt:\n\nFederal Student Loans - ~$25,000 on PAYE plan planning to use the PSLF (I know all about the rules and how many people have actually gotten forgiveness etc please don't discuss it in this post)\n\nAltima- $4,000 with a 1.5% APR Navy Federal\n\nNo credit card debt (Paid off each month)\n\nAssets:\n\nRoth TSP: ~$4,000 \nChecking and Savings (Liquid assets): $23,000\n\nCredit: 752 on TU, 729 on EF, 750 on EX ; impeccable payment history ; about $55,000 in available credit from my credit cards.\n\nWe're thinking of getting an SUV such as a CR-V, CH-R or RAV4 which are all around $25,000 . The Sienna and Odyssey are both around $30,000+ which is pretty damn expensive IMO. Of course this is for 2019 models. We are open to buying recent year used models. Don't want to go too far back though as I've had enough of car issues on my primary car.\n\nI guess the options we have are:\n\n1. Buy a 2019 model at the dealership and try to negotiate\/get a better deal (How to do this IDK but that's a separate discussion). Use pre approved financing from Navy Federal or possibly dealer financing if its a better deal.\n\n2. Buy a Certified Pre Owned\/ Recent used car at dealership. Same as above.\n\n3. Buy a recent used car from private party with a Navy Federal pre approved loan.\n\nAlong with the above I have the option of either:\n\n1. Trading in Altima at dealership and adding negative equity to other loan (Probably a raw deal)\n\n2. Paying Altima off cash and selling private party with title in hand\n\n3. Keeping Altima and fixing its issues little by little - drive it till it blows up.\n\nI appreciate your advice; especially on how I can get a better deal if I go the new car route.","112":"First HHG move for me.

However due to years of bad financial handling sometimes things pop up. This time I don't know if it could be an error or a case of identity theft. \n\nHe received a letter from ERC (Enhanced Recovery) dated July 3rd stating that he owed around $1500 dollars to SunTrust Bank. Problem is he had not had an account with SunTrust since 2003 (at which time it was only a checking account closed in good standing, no loans or lines of credit). Basically he has no relationship at all with that bank.\n\nI'm trying to figure out where to go from here. Obviously there's 30 days to dispute the debt which I'll be sending a letter along with a copy of the POA as I've done before to request verification\/proof of the debt being owed. The debt does not appear on his credit file as far as I can tell on credit karma (TU and EF); and the file has never shown any line of credit with SunTrust bank (if it did I would have noticed a while ago when checking his credit in the past). This makes me wonder if it actually is a legitimate debt from an identity theft or whether its just an error\/junk debt\/scam from ERC.\n\nI appreciate advice on where to go after the debt dispute letter. Should I contact SunTrust to ask them the validity of the supposedly owed upon account?","115":"It's kind of like the foam in gun cases or proposal cases but the brand stuff is super expensive.

My wife, although willing to listen and comfort me, does not really get the intricacies of whats going on because she's obviously different down there, and not many of my guy friends relly want to hear me bitch and moan about my dick. In the best of scenarios maybe someone here can relate with what I'm going through. I'm not here for nor am I expecting medical advice online, I'm here to see if I'm alone in this or anyone could have an idea what could be going on.\n\nI'm going to keep it brief because I can go on for days about this shitty experience but essentially about 4 months ago I was living life to the fullest, getting ready to head out for training (I'm in the military) and I felt like weird electric shock go down my penis like I needed to take the most emergent piss in history. Never felt that before. I did and still felt like I needed to urinate. Of course first thing that comes to mind is a UTI. Long sotry short the doctor does a urine test and ofund no infection\/bacteria. I get some one dose antibiotics and go home. No dice, now my gooch starts to hurt like someone is stabbing it. I can't even drive without pain. Grab my wife and head to the ER; after 5 hours waiting the doctor once again finds no bacteria in urine, says she doesn't know what it could be and says the testicular ultrasound they did was also good. Go back home. Next day I tell the doctor that not only did my perineum hurt but so did the inside of my rectum. He does a DRE and says its good but to be on the safe side diagnoses me as having \"prostatitis\" and gives me a bunch of antibiotics. Both in the clinic and hospital all STD tests come back clean (which I knew it would because I'm completely monogamous).\n\nI take the antibiotics and it is very effective in screwing me up in many ways (I got jock itch, oral trush, stomach issues from it) but doesn't do anything for the issue. I get told if I'm not better I can't go to training so I \"man up\" and head off to training. For the next 2 and a half months symptoms range from rectal pain, perineal pain, urinary urgency, sometimes I feel something in the rectum twitch, or my penis twitching. I lost the \"ability\" to push out urine towards the  Eventually though most of these issues subside and I'm left with one symptom that definitely has to be the most annoying of all:\n\nEvery single time I use the bathroom, either I urinate or especially if I do #2, I have no pain or issue while urinating - stream is strong, no hesitancy etc (Thank God). But without fail 5 minutes later my penis\/urethra and the Perineum becomes sore and tender and sensitive. If I touch either in the correct spot it feels like a sharp needle in there. Almost always the same spot  if I close my legs or do a kegel type of movement or sneeze or stretch, same thing. This lasts maybe 30 minutes or an hour and goes back to normal, absolutely no issue until I have to inevitably urinate again. My urethra also always seems to be red\/inflamed.\n\nThis is driving me insane. I have to deal with a literal pain in the dick\/anus every day. And I'm starting to think I'm stuck like this forever. Now of course you're wondering why I haven't gone to the doctor again and it's just been an unfortunate circumstance of where I've been stuck for this time. I will be able to get this more looked at soon but this is causing me some real anxiety. It seems that no matter what might be wrong the outcome is not good. I've never had any health issues before this. Again and again I keep thinking I've got either an urethral stricture or some sort of growth\/cancer down there. \n\nHave other people here dealt with issues like this?

At this point I've realized that my symptoms is basically this:\n\nNot DURING but maybe 5-10 minutes after urination or a bowel movement (which usually is accompanied by urination of course), I'll feel a very specific pinch\/stabbing\/burn\/internal paper cut\/ grain of sand feeling in the same spot of my anterior urethra basically right in front of where the front of the testicles connect to the penis. Should also mention ita right in front of where the bulbourethral (Cowper's) gland should be. \n\nIf I touch this spot with my fingers and press, it hurts more. If I contract my kegel muscles( same one used to push out urine), it hurts more while I do it. If I press my things together towards the center around where the perineum is, it hurts more while I do it. \n\nAlso the Perineum is also a little sore\/tender when the urethra is. After 10 minutes to an hour, it's gone. Until I urinate again then it starts all over.\n\nIt is like my urine is acidic or some shit and is making that spot burn. Or somehow there is something wrong on the muscular level and I can feel it in the urethra.\n\nWhat truly worries me is there being or developing a stricture - which seems like a huge pain in the ass to take care of. However my urine stream is not at all weak, I don't usually have urgency or frequency, I can urinate just fine. Only difference is before I used to push the last 2 or 3 spurts of urine out using my kegel muscles now nothing really happens if I do that. \n\nOn a separate but related note I don't produce nearly the amount of pre ejaculate I used to (I typically was like a fountain) and my semen has become highly viscous and elastic, it's no longer as \"lubed up\" as it used to be . But this wouldn't point to a muscle problem so I'm at a loss. Sorry for the graphic description.

I am recently married and my first child is due in November this year. My wife is a (legal) immigrant and currently does not work as we're still getting green card in order.My financial situation is a follows:\n\nSavings:\n\n- $20,000 in savings accounts\n\n- About $3,500 in TSP High three (not BRS)\n\nDebt: \n\n- Around $32,000 in federal student loans currently on the PAYE plan at $42 a month, not covering interest - planning to use the 10 year PSLF program.\n- $4100 auto loan for my 2006 Altima with Navy federal at 2.2% APR\n- No credit card debt\n\nMonthly Budget:\n\n- $5,932 income after taxes and TSP\n- $2,160 in total bills not including rent (includes savings to take a yearly trip overseas to see the in laws)\n- Anything left over after rent goes into savings\n\nOur BAH for the area will $2,925 a month; and we have seen multiple listings online of houses for about $1,500 to $1,800 for 2 BR and around $2,100 for 3 BR (not really needed).\n\nSince I'm just moving to the area this first year I plan to rent probably a 2 BR home for around $1,700 a month which will leave me with a monthly budget surplus of about $2,222 a month. I haven't entertained the idea of buying a home too much because I saw my parents lose their house in the recession and just get screwed overall so I'm a little skeptical of home ownership and I don't want to go for some overvalued house that will lose value. However, my wife looked up 3 BR homes in the area and there are some really nice looking houses for about $160,000 to $190,000 (most I would ever want to pay for a house). I used one of the VA home loan calculators and with my 750 credit score and history and even with $0 down, it looks like my monthly mortgage payment with financing fee, insurance, and taxes would be about $1100. Of which about $700 is principal and interest. This is of course a $1000 a month savings to a similar home rental.\n\nMy insecurity comes in when it comes time to PCS again. My billet is 4 years and if I buy the house after 1 year I would have 3 years left before PCSing. I am not keen to renting out a house across the country as its too much of a liability for me and prefer to just cash out at PCS time and try to sell. I am not some crystal-ball guru or anyting but my gut rells me we're coming close to another recession\/downturn\/bull market\/etc etc whatever you want to call it and if that happened I imagine houses would come down in price. I feel afraid that I buy a house for $190,000 and when it comes time to PCS I can't get more than $140,000 for it due to the economy.  This is what happened to my parents and I don't want it happening to me. One of my petty officers told me that the VA loan has some sort of \"insurance\" or \"protection\" where if you have negative equity on the home and you are PCSing, they \"forgive\" the portion that you are underwater on (in this case the $50,000 I didn't get in the sale). I can't find that ANYWHERE though so I imagine its BS.\n\nFurthermore I don't hope for it but I've been having health issues recently that may or may not affect my ability to stay in\/reenlist but that in the worst and most unlikely of scenarios. It's something that makes me think though.\n\nWhat are your recommendations? If I can sell the house for the same or more than what I bought it I could get back a lot of what I paid in mortgage as well as save more of my income which would help me to reach that $100,000 in savings goal that I have.\n\nI appreciate everyone's advice.","139":"I have to do my first PCS cross country and want to take a couple things more than fit in the trunk of my altima.

(This post is not an April fools joke, serious question).\n\nI started my enlistment process in 2015, shipped out in early 2016 and graduated on time. I completed my eqip as around the beginning of 2016 with all the information I had at the time down to every single trip abroad. Some information, mainly concerning my only foreign contact - my girlfriend, has changed (we got engaged). Anyways, it's now April 2017 and I have had pretty much no word of when my clearance will be approved, or disapproved, or reviewed, or anything. I am now red on CGBI for it. \n\nI had received an email from an investigator in my home of record state that wanted to do an interview with me and I informed them I'd be glad to but was now in another state where I was stationed. So they said they would have to transfer my case to an investigator of that state. That was middle 2016. Since then I have heard nothing. I sent an email to my chief who sent it to the civilian security officer who only stated that the status was \"in process, sent to SECCEN\", and that I could request a temporary clearance if needed for my duties (according to command, I don't need it for my duties as a non rate at my unit). \n\nSo Chief, along with some other NCOs, security officer, etc have all said it is taking a while because OPM\/SECCEN is backed up and I need to wait. However, I'm getting a little concerned about the length of time it is taking. I'm on the MST A-school list and although I know the rate doesn't need clearance I am concerned most units will and I will be very limited on where I can go without one, I'd like to have it before being rated. Furthermore, as I stated, I am now engaged and my fiance and I are starting the application for a fiance visa which should be approved (hopefully) by this time next year. I'd like to be able to inform OPM\/update eqip\/something that I will be marrying a foreign national so it doesn't end up being a \"surprise\" (although everyone at my unit already knows).\n\nTO conclude this essay, question is what you all recommend. Continue to be patient or dig a little further? Maybe set up an appointment with the sec officer, although he doesn't really like to have them? Contact OPM directly? Or just do everything through CoC? Also, are my worries warranted that not having a clearance would limit my units and career as an MST? Any and all advice is appreciated, please help a confused non rate out D:\n\n\nTL;DR\n- Been waiting for clearance for over a year\n\n-Was contacted by investigator in home state that said case would be transferred to an investigator in my unit's state\n\n-No word so far\n\n-Security officer, chief, etc tell me OPM\/SECCEN is backed up so need to wait\n\n-Concerned that its taking too long\/not having clearance might screw me as an MST if I don't get it before school\n\n-Will soon be marrying foreigner so would like to be able to explain changes to an investigator so they don't feel like I didn't inform.\n\n-What should I do?

I started my first career job last year (3k a month) and decided last month to get my first real credit cards to do more to keep building credit (previously had a wells fargo card that I rarely used).\n\n I ALWAYS pay on time, never accrue interest, don't spend more than I have. I ended up getting a Barclays Arrival plus for the sign in bonus and originally applied for a Chase Sapphire but was rejected for low account age even though my score is around 750 with perfect payments. So I got a Quicksilver for \"daily use\" instead. All this was done in January so I imagine my credit took a hit.\n\n\nISSUE:\n\nAnyways the other day I wanted to purchase a higher end keyboard so I went to Guitar Center to take advantage of the 12 month interest free financing; to be informed it only works with their store card. Without thinking I applied for it and got instantly approved for 2.5k, only to find out that the keyboard I wanted was out of stock. I ended up purchasing a guitar that I took a liking to that was only 120 dollars, and placed it on the card since it was already approved. So I'll be paying 10 dollars a month for a guitar. I ended up finding the keyboard I wanted for half the price used on craigslist. \n\nQUESTION:\n\nSince its pointless for me to have tihs card now that I have the keyboard, and paying 10 bucks a month for a guitar is kind of ridiculous, is there any way I can just cancel this card? I feel like having a store card is just going to do negative things to my credit and be a burden. Is the hard hit to my credit irreversible? Is it smart to cancel this card since I already have a low \"account age average\"?

After the events of the previous thread she didn't really talk to her parents until last night. This is normal for them as she doesn't talk to her parents often, especially her father.\n\nI will be flying to visit her at the end of the month and will be there for about 2 weeks; I got everything ready on my end, requested my leave, bought my ticket, and we are both excited about the trip. I even bought her engagement ring yesterday. However, she wanted to know whether or not her parents wanted to meet me, and so she sent her father a message asking him if I should go to meet her parents; when they talked he did not approve, he doesn't want to meet me or have anything to do with me, and I'm sure he just plain doesn't like me. I don't care, that is fine, as I am not marrying her parents. However, that obviously affected her and caused her once again to cry and feel lost about the situation.\n\nAfterwards her mother talked to her and made things even worse, saying that she couldn't believe my girlfriend would leave them, that's she can't believe it, she feels betrayed etc etc etc. She said if my girlfriend leaves Japan she will never talk to her again, etc. \n\nSo here I am trying to comfort her and she gets a call from her father in which sheis informed that her mother basically had a nervous breakdown over the thought of her leaving the country, and she wasn't in her right mind. She basically had an episode of acute delirium from either the stress or the sadness of thinking her daughter would move overseas. It is such an unhealthy attachment to her that I still can't believe it. According to my girlfriend, she never saw her mother have a response like that to anything before. \n\nAt this moment I heard her cry like I never heard her cry before. She just kept wailing and wailing like a baby and asking me what she should do and I wanted to say something to comfort her or to find a logical solution to the situation, but I couldn't. I didn't know what to say at all and all I could do is cry as well, because I hate to see her in pain and I can't believe that because of me someone I don't even know is losing their health.\n\nEventually she calmed down and called her aunt to go help her father and her mother was taken to the hospital where they found no neurological issues and just determined she had a breakdown from psychological trauma. I guess now she is just recovering from the incident, but I can't stop feeling uneasy about the whole situation. I know that my girlfriend can't live like this, with her mother waging psychological warfare on her and making her life harder than it needs to be. \n\nI am trying to convince her that things will be okay and trying to lessen her logical fears about moving out of country and when she is gaining some confidence her mother cries bloody death. \n\nI told her yesterday the best thing for her parents and for her and everyone is if we just ended the relationship but that made her even more sad than anything else and she says she doesn't want that. I am trying to make sure that she is still sure about her decision to be with me but understandably right now she doesn't want to talk about that since her mother is ill and the only thing she is worried about at the moment is that her mother will be fine. So she asked me to stop pestering her with questions about us until her mother is better. The plan right now is she will go to her hometown on a day off to talk with her parents, or just her father if her mother is too unstable, about her plans and about me, as she has not done that in person.\n\nI just don't know what to do. I know that she loves me, she is always thinking about me every single day, she always calls me to spend time together even just on the phone, she sends me gifts, she took time off from work to spend 2 weeks together. We have been together for 25 months and known each other for 30 months and I can't imagine my life without her. She tells me to trust her and that she hasn't changed her mind about us (although she always ends it with \"so far\"), but I am so afraid that she will not be able to choose me over everything and be happy with just me. I would give up my parents right now if I had to, to be with her; without a second thought. I don't understand if she truly loves me why she can't seem to do the same. I am becoming afraid that after all this time and everything we have done and everything we have planned she'll just default to growing old alone in her hometown so she doesn't hurt her mother's feelings rather than choosing what makes her happy. \n\nDo you all believe a relationship and a marriage can last under this situation? Everything would be going smoothly if her mother simply wasn't in the picture but the reality is her mother will never stop trying to guilt and bully her into doing what she wants and I don't believe anymore that my girlfriend is strong enough to overcome that issue.","155":"","156":"[removed]","157":"","158":"Hello everyone.

Any advice please?","162":"Many people have recently stated that the US is a very racist country, or that many people in the US are racist. I agree that the US has a considerable amount of racist people, AND I believe that everyone has stereotypes that they believe, although for most people, such stereotypes are harmless and reflect aspects of certain characters in the media (the sassy black lady, the tough Russian, the smart Asian, the white kid who likes Green Day). Even ones that can seem negative (the pushy Christian, the annoying Indian customer service guy, the aggressive Irishman), are acknowledged as stereotypes and not taking very seriously. In general, these people will not treat a black lady or a Russian differently because they are of a different skin color or nationality or ethnicity.\nHowever, even with the existence of Americans that are racist, and certain discriminatory phenomenon that we have witnessed in the system, I would argue that the US is one of the LEAST racist countries in the world; if not the least. The reason for this is that the US is inherently a country of diversity. The US has no homogenous national identity that traces back to a tribe, or a clan, or a creation story, or a campaign of conquest. The US simply claims a national identity on an idea of government and a set of values that are outlined in its constitution. We are not held together by religion or culture or race. We are held together by the communal agreement that a citizen of the US needs only to \"support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same\" (taken from the Naturalization Oath of Allegiance).\n\n\nAlthough the US has had periods of large-scale racism from slavery and segregation of blacks, and limitation of immigration to certain races such as Asians or Hispanics, in general, and especially in the US of today, An American is an American. There is no importance to the \"purity of your blood\"; it doesn't matter if your parents worked a certain job that could be considered filthy, it doesn't matter if the caste in your birth country was low or high, it doesn't even matter if your politics lean one way or the other, most serious Americans will not question your \"American-ness\" or your legitimacy as an American. If you have legally been born or naturalized as an American citizen, even if you are a legal permanent resident, and if you bear faith to the values outlined in our constitution, you are equal. There is a lot of work to be done to change negative perceptions and behaviors, and to limit the damage that can be caused by racism at the individual level; however I have never felt more at home and more included than I have when I am with other Americans. Some of them are darker or lighter, maybe they have a funny accent, maybe their English is bad, maybe they pray on a mat rather than holding hands, some of them are more outgoing and loud and others are more reserved and serious, but they are all Americans. We are bound by something that is above any culture because US culture is the WORLD culture.\nEven with modern globalization, the US is one of the few places in the world (the others being Canada, and certain European nations) where it is not strange or uncommon to see different places of worship all in one roadway, or where you can speak another language without getting strange looks or where you can work at a Starbucks in a hijab without almost anyone sneering, or where the first thing you are told at basic military training, where YOU the individual doesn't matter, is that your right to practice your religion is of the utmost importance and reasonable accommodations will be provided on request.\n\n\nThis is a commodity in many other countries. In Latin America Catholicism reigns as the majority and official religion and while you are allowed to practice your religion and have a mosque or a temple or a synagogue, nobody is going to go out of their way to accommodate you because \"we are a Catholic country\". In much of Asia, especially in China and Japan, racism is accepted and ingrained in all levels of society. While dark skinned people are treated the worst, many times people not considered pure are subject to casual and accepted discrimination that nobody cares to acknowledge or change. In Africa some people from different tribes or countries right next to each other will hate each other. In India the Caste system is still a thing to an extent. The US is a country in which practically anyone from any part of the world can come and have success and become an equal member to the guy born here. In many places in the world, this isn't the case. It may be possible (albeit extremely difficult) to move to and reside in a nation such as Japan or Jordan for the long term, you will never be considered a \"true Japanese\", or a \"real Jordanian\". You will always be the foreigner, the alien.\n\n\nI think that due to recent events and by shameless, purposeful and despicable attempts by a biased media from both sides of the political spectrum to incite hatred between Americans on the basis of race or color or ethnicity, we have lost sight of what we truly are, a nation of immigrants and workers. While we may become annoyed or even angry at each other often, like a good group of siblings, we would never think of breaking our familiar bond over issues that have a solution, and we would defend each other from others who seek to do any of us harm, just as any sibling would","163":"Hello everyone, I'd appreciate some advice.\n\nI (22) met my girlfriend (24) when she came to study abroad in the US and we spent that year together, and now have spent a year and a half away from each other.

They said she is \"betraying\" them for wanting to come live with me. They asked her if she came to the US just to find a man, and that helping her go was a mistake.  They also pulled the \"we did so much for you\" card, reminding her they paid for her college and studies abroad. In summary, they expect her to move back to her hometown and take over the family business (a local sports good store).\n\nWhen she asked if she would meet me if I went to visit Japan, her mother said if her father did not want to see me, she doesn't either. In essence without even meeting me her parents hate me, and I believe it is a mix of them feeling like I am taking her away and just classic Japanese xenophobia. \n\nLuckily my girlfriend told me this doesn't change her feelings or plans and that whatever decision she makes in the future will be her own. However, she is devastated and depressed that her parents rejected my gifts, and that they want nothing to do with me, or with her future family if she marries me. She said in her mind she wanted her parents to be at her wedding and hold her child but it probably won't happen. I am angry and sad at these people and I can't believe the amount of negativity and lack of empathy they have towards their own daughter. They seem more concerned about who's going to man the cash register at the store than their daughter's happiness.\n\nI don't know what to tell er or what to do.

I am lost as to how this process is supposed to work so I need to figure out if everything is going smoothly or not.\n\nI'm in a bit of a unique situation as I am in the military and am in training across the country for the whole first trimester; and my wife is back home in California. She's an immigrant from Japan so there's no family or anything there to keep her company; fortunately our neighbors have been very nice and helping her out so she's not completely alone. I am frustrated that I can't be there for the appointments and doctor visits and because she is not from the US she tends to be shy and not ask questions regarding her care or why something is being done a certain way etc.\n\nWe got a recommendation for a doctor who is her Primary Care Manager in Tricare at our town. He's a nice guy but he is only a family doctor and not a OB\/Gyn so I worry that he's not looking at tings as an OB\/Gyn would. She went for her first visit and got a referral for her first ultrasound at the local hospital as well as a couple standard blood tests and urine test including a gestational diabetes screening as her father is type II. \n\nShe went to the ultrasound and the tech didn't say a word or explain what she was seeing or anything. She just let him do his thing as he wouldn't answer questions. She saw the doctor again 2 weeks later and he confirmed that the gestational diabetes screening was failed at 2 hours and she has gestational diabetes. He also indicated there may be a thyroid issue as TSH was very low and orderd a free T4 test, an H1 hemoglobin test and a referral to a program called \"sweet success\" which has to do with the gestational diabetes. He also ordered a California first trimester screening which I guess is a blood test to screen for birth defect risk. All these are to be done at LabCorp.\n\n We asked about the ultrasound and copies of the images but he said he only received results from the ultrasound and that it \"looks good and normal, one fetus\". He said the images needed to be ordered from the hospital. I had made a records request from the hospital and they called and told my wife that they did not have copies of the images - they would ask the radiologist and \"see if he has the images\". In the end they lost the ultrasound images. When we asked the doctor of when the next ultrasound would be, or if her had some sort of appointment scehdule outlining the pregnancy process etc he said he didn't. He said they would do one more ultrasound at 20 weeks and no more. \n\nThis is what is blowing our mind right now. In Japan women have an ultrasound done **every single appointment** so usually once a month. My mother in Florida had an ultrasound done in the OB\/Gyns office every single appointment. However this doctor only wants it done pretty much once. Is it normal to just have one or two ultrasounds?? Its really stressing my wife out and she feels that its important to have ultrasounds done regularly. We're also kind of in the dark about the gestational diabetes as she was just referred to a hospital in Berkeley to do the sweet success program but thats it. When I asked via phone speaker dring the last appointment if it was possible for the doctor to recommend any safe medicines to help with morning sickness as my wife has had 24\/7 mild-moderate sickness for the past 5 weeks and can't stomach anything except rice he said he didn't think it was necessary to take medicine and that was that. I don't understand how she's supposed to stick to a strict diet for her GD if she physically cannot eat anything other than a bowl of rice for breakfast lunch and dinner.\n\nI told my wife she should go to an actual OB\/Gyn office which there is one in our town but now we'll have to wait until 3 or 4 weeks from now to get a referral for an Ob\/Gyn because when I asked if he could do the referral last appointment he said he didn't think it was necessary. Please help I'm about losing my mind stuck on this goddamn base instead of helping my wife out with this stuff.","178":"Good evening everyone. I hope fathers-to-be can post here as well. I have a bit of a unique question and my wife doesn't use Reddit so I was hoping to get some information\/advice. \n\nMy wife is full Japanese and tells me that from what she has read online of accounts of other Japanese women who migrated to the US; the screen for gestational diabetes weighs more heavily on East Asian women since they have a high consumption of carbs mainly due to rice and most of them have failed the 2 or even 3 hour screen. She's a little worried that she might fail it too and possibly have a false positive for GD although she may actually be fine. Apparently in Japan they don't really do the GD test until much later and unless there is symptoms. She is 8 weeks in but because her father had diabetes (which is well managed now) the doctor wants her to do the screen now. \n\nI'm out of the loop on this topic so any help is appreciated. Is GD risk actually pretty overblown or is this something that should be taken more seriously? Anyone that fits the same profile as my wife that could chime in? \n\nThanks","179":"Hello everyone.\n\nPreviously I've dealt with lower back tightness\/pain\/slight sciatica which I never really dealt with. For about 6 months before this, I noticed that I'd have to push a little bit more times to get the last bit of urine out, and would dribble a couple drops after finishing. No other symptoms.\n\nOn March 17th, my wife gave me the last of three massages on my piriformis muscle since I had a knot\/trigger point there, and we move it down into the butt cheek thinking it fixed the back issue. At night I went to a couple bars and drank a lot (I never do this); got home and went to sleep. I woke up at about 4 AM and urinated for about 45 seconds non stop. I ever thought \"Wow I was really full\". Then I went back to sleep.\n\nNext morning I sat down on the computer; masturbated once and noticed not a whole lot of semen cam eout although this is normal when you do it too quick. About 10 minutes later I felt a very starnge sensation in the penis\/urethra (might be what I feel now but now used to it). I went to the bathroom and urinated but it didn't really stop the discomfort. Told my wife I might have a UTI. About an hour later I had a powerful bowel movement (I have dealt with what is most likely IBS for a while, get that about twice a year) which made me feel a lot better. I even told my wife I think I just had a big gas bubble and went on with my day.\n\nThat night the discomfort came back. I went to the clinic at my base (I am in the military) and the PA tested for STIs, urine test, mentioned the urethra looked a little red. Urine test negative for bacteria. SO he was about to send me on my way but I told him it was painful and uncomfortable especially to sit down. So he gave me the STD regimen of Azythromycin and the injection.\n\nI went to work and started to get constant pain in my perineum IMMEDIATELY behind the point where the scrotum and perineum meet; made worse if palpated. It was pretty much the only symptom.\n\nSpot of pain: https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/uQ94FFK\n\nI went to the ER where the doctor touched the spot and it hurt. At least she was honest and said \"I don't really know what your issue could be\". She ordered an ultrasound of scrotum and testicles and the spot where it hurt, all normal. No bacteria in urine.\n\nNext day I went to the clinic to follow up the ER visit and saw another doctor who I explained my symptoms better to. The only real issues was a pain the \"perineum\" that was made better (felt relief) when spreading my buttcheeks with my hands (basically stretching the anus ). He did a rectal exam and said he couldn't do it super well because I flinched but he did not feel anything out of the ordinary. However he said he would treat it as an acute prostatitis and prescribed Bactrim DS twice a day for 1 month.\n\nI went home and took the bactrim and went to sleep. In the morning I had bactrim side effects like anxiety, tingling etc, but the perineal pain was a lot better than before. Doctor called me and said it was good news that I felt that way.\n\nI took the bactrim for 2 weeks during which time I made some lifestyle changes such as walking around for a couple hours a day to \"get my mind off things\" and stopped being excessively worried about the issue. During this time I would feel better each day but every once in a while I'd feel the pinch\/pain either in the perineal spot or farther up along the urethra  at the spot where the scrotum meets the penis. I imagined it was just the \"infection\" being wiped out little by little.\n\nThe bactrim made me start having digestive issues. First I was constipated so I took one senna pill and next day I was having watery diarrhea. Not to mention it made me feel very weak and a little anxious.  End of week 2 I started having muscular\/joint pain on my right leg which I never had before (back leg pain had always been on the left) and I could still feel the pinch and I ended up having a panic attack from catastrophic thinking amplified by bactrim. At the clinic the doctor said he wouldn't think bactrim could cause the issue but changed me to cipro. I have a molecular biology degree and know what cipro can do; so I said thank you, received the cipro, went home and continued with bactrim. Each day my stool was a little different, and I always had a bunch of gas, most of it trapped. I could feel the gas pressure (or it may have been muscle soreness) in my anus and rectum especially when sleeping. 5 days later I'm at a park and get a lot of itching in my anus; when I had a bowel movement my anus burned like mad and there was a little bright red blood when wiping: I developed a hemorroid (or this whole issue might be a big hemorroid; who knows?). The perineal pain kind of came and went but overall it was mostly gone. I developed jock itch and fungal balanitis a couple days later, as well as oral thrush due to the bactrim killing off all my bacteria (so it did work...) I had to start taking Nystatin for the trush and antifungal creams for the crotch fungi. No big deal. I stopped taking the bactrim but still had the pinch in the urethra\/forward perineum even the day after. I became convinced this was not a bacterial infection.\n\nI didn't follow up more with this including PT because I was set to fly out to a training school I have waited over 3 years for. The school is across the country for 3 months. I flew out and had only a little discomfort on the flight. I arrived at the school and we got our asses chewed out as tehy do in the military which flared up the urethral\/perineal pinch\/pain once again. I also had to sit for a long time in class. It wasn't unbearable like the day I went to the ER, bu constant and annoying. This was this week.\n\nI mainly felt the pinch when actually placing or raising my butt off a chair. Right in the spot of the image. Also sometimes when lifting my knees towards my chest or turning my body sideways; I could feel the pinch for a second or two. It kind of came and went last week. I had bought a foam roller and tennis balls to do trigger point and stretches such as Uptown Mike's and made the mistake to release a trigger point in my left psoas\/other muscle around there between the leg joint and lower stomach. It hurt like hell when doing but seemed to release it. Next morning I took a PT test and did exercise as were required to do a lot of exercise here; and all day I had muscular somach pain, urge to urinate constantly, and shooting sort of  \"electric\/pressure\" sensation down my penis\/urethra but this time from the top part mostly. I also dealt with gas and reflux the entire week. That was a very difficult day.\n\nAt night I went to sleep with a LOT of abdominal pain (I began to think I might have a colon\/GI issue - kind of lead me to make this post) and catastrophized it might be colon cancer\/Chron's\/Diverticulitis etc. and becae super anxious; eventually I fell asleep when the bod and mind relaxed. \n\nThe next morning (3 days ago) was a GREAT day (maybe due to the exercise the day before). No constant perineal pain; even when sitting or standing from a seat; even touching the spot would not cause the pain. I thought I was 100% cured. However I still had a lot of gas and began to notice that I could \"feel\" gas pressure\/gas pain in my urethra at the spot. My stools have been very mucusy and kind of fibrous but this started after bactrim so it may be an issue of the gut flora; for which I'm taking probiotic pills. I also noticed when I went to the bathroom and had a bowel movement or contracted my anal sphincter (same muscles you use to push out urine when finished) I would feel the pinch in the regular spot in the urethra. Sometimes it would last a couple minutes or hours after; sometimes it would not last long than putting my pants on. Yesterday and today have been pretty similar. My only symptoms remain to be sore back\/glute\/between leg and pelvis muscles, hemorroids are pretty much gone but sometimes I feel the burn, the pinch in one or both of the two urethral spots when moving a certain way or during\/after using my anal muscles to close and open the sphincter; lots of gas that creates a weird pressure feeling in my urethra when rectum has the gas; also very very rarely I'll feel the urge to urinate but its not as bad as to be a concern and usually I am not empty anyways. As for ejaculation it's not really painful at all, however the semen does not shoot out forcefully as usual and may just dribble out\/be very watery; and the actual semen is very stretchy and snaps when stretched kind of like the slime toys they make nowadays but maybe it was always this way. Sometimes when I feel the pinch ejaculation or simply getting and erection make it go away. I suspect a bulbospongiosus muscle cause.\n\nThat's where I am at; at this point its more of an annoyance and worry regarding \"could it be something more serious\" than painful but it's still there. I have good days and bad days; but I haven't even started the stretching\/yoga\/trigger points. \n\nI feel like this might actually be muscle related more than anything but I am not ruling out some sort of growth in the rectum that is causing referred rectal pain in the urethra through some shared nerve. In any case I'm hoping stretching and exercise these three months will cure this thing. I feel that either the puborectalis  muscle, levator ani muscle and\/or bulbospongiosus muscle (right below where I feel the pinch) or an entrapment\/issue of some part of the pudendal\/perineal nerve may be the cause of this issue in my case. If anyone has experienced these issues (mainly pain that spot\/urethra WHEN\/DURING\/AFTER\/EXASCERBATED\/CAUSED by opening\/closing of the anal sphincter or bowel movement, please please please let me know.\n\nAlso any and all advice is appreciated; I hope to start the stretches soon this week.","180":"","181":"So I'll admit I don't really know what I am doing but my wife is 99% for sure pregnant and ik trying to figure things out.

I had to mature super early because I had to help my father find work, deal with repossessions, etc at 13 years old. \n\nMy parents immigrated to the United States back in 2001 and they just can't seem to get their footing after the recession. When they got here work was abundant and wages were good now I feel like it's almost impossible to support oneself. The minimum wage in Florida is 8.45 and practically any job that my father would qualify for pays that. He's been at a job that pays 12 an hour for the last couple years but it seems it's coming to an end as he allowed them to not pay him all the hours he has worked ( worked for example 55 hours but got paid 40 for years, he didn't keep documentation to prove this. Now his hours have been lowered to 30 a week but they still want him to work 40). \n\nEver since I joined the military and started making my own money almost half goes into the black hole that is supporting my father and little sister. I got married last year and my wife is dropping hints that she is getting frustrated of the situation. She asked why my father has so much problems and bad luck. And she's right. Every day it's an issue in my father's house. Either problems at his work with them not paying wages or trying to lower his hours, it not paying a bill on time and getting threats of collections. I've spent the last two months organizing his finances, I got a power of attorney, removing negative make from how credit. I put in two months deposit and first month and paid for a $1200 move so he could get out of the extremely high lease he was at for the lowest lease I could find for him and my sister at 1200 a month. I spent like 4500 dollars to do so. And now that I think things are going to be well as his expenses are finally equal to his income, the scrooges at his work said they are lowering his hours to 6 a week instead of 8 (but he's required to complete a delivery route that takes 7-10 hours regardless). So now he's making 500 dollars less a month. \n\nAnd to make the story even better it looks be I now have a full on the way. I am just tied of having to support my family and also give a have to my father every month because goddamn Florida can't be bothered to raise the minimum wage to a logical level even though rents have gone up by 33 percent in Orlando in 3 years. I dont see a way to out to my situation. My father had looked for work but he's 64 years old, got limited English and no higher education in the USA and can't get into a professional field. I have applied to jobs for him and he had personally applied to jobs but nothing ever even responds. Practically everything pays 8.45 an hour which barely covers rent. And my mother who lives separated from him doesn't give a single penny to help out.\n\nI am caught between looking it for my own will being and family's future and not leaving my father to fend for himself and possibly end up in the street. I spoke to priest a couple times but their hello is limited to emotional support which I appreciate but unfortunately words of encouragement don't pay the bills. All I ask and pay to God for is a job with a livable wage for him and it seems like an impossibility. I'm honestly beginning depressed about this issue. I live anxious every single day about the situation, all I think about is how I can fix the issue, how I need to make more money, how I'm not saving enough for my own future. I can't focus at work, I don't even feel like doing things for fun and lately I get annoyed when my wife tries to cuddle and stuff with me because I'm just not in the mood. Worst thing is whenever I explain this situation to people at work or friends they just tell me to abandon my parents and sister and let them get screwed as if it were so way to just tell my parents who raised me to go to hell.

The collections agency is repoting erroneous information to the credit bureau by stating that the accounts are from 2014 when they received the account from the original creditor, rather than 2010. \n\nI sent an email regarding this and they told me to fax them due to privacy concerns, along with the power of attorney for my father (these are his debts, I'm acting as an agent). The letter was as follows:\n\n\"\nXXXXXX. Inc.\nXXXXs Avenue\nXXXX FL 33912\n\nMs. XXXXX,\n\nThis cover letter is in response to your request for a copy of the Durable Power of Attorney granted to me by my father XXXXX, hereinafter referred to as \u201cPrincipal\u201d in this and all other communications from me to your company. For your records, a copy of the email sent to you on 02\/18\/2019 is attached to this fax along with a copy of the Durable Power of Attorney. In your request you also asked to be informed where you could send correspondence regarding this matter. Send all correspondence to the following address:\n\nXXXXXXXX (My address)\n\nAs mentioned previously, I am requesting verification for any and all alleged debts which your company is attempting to collect on pursuant to Sec. 809 of the Fair Debit Collection Practices Act. I request to be provided with the following:\n\n\u2022 Name and address of alleged creditor.\n\u2022 Name on file of alleged debtor.\n\u2022 Alleged account number.\n\u2022 Amount of alleged debt.\n\u2022 Date this alleged debt became payable.\n\u2022 Date of original charge off or delinquency.\n\nLet this serve as notice that any such alleged debts are disputed and you **must stop cease and desist all collection activities for these debts pursuant to Sec. 809 of the Fair Debit Collection Practices Act.** This includes communication to me or the Principal for any reason **other than** written verification of this debt or confirming receipt of this letter and Durable Power of Attorney, and reporting of inaccurate or erroneous information to any credit reporting agency. \n\nI appreciate your time and attention.\n\nSincerely,\n\nXXXX as Agent for XXXXX\n\nAs I had not received an email back from them concerning receipt of this fax, I gave them a call letting them know they were being recorded. I was calling simply to know if they were going to send verification of the debt and if they had received the power of attorney. The representative on the phone told me to hold (I imagine she was speaking to their legal department) and then told me that they could not speak to me because \"I had sent them a cease and desist\". I imagine they are referring to the bolded statement above. According to them, because I sent this, they cannot speak to me, nor can they send verification of the debts that they are attempting to collect on. They say I must rescind the \"cease and desist\" in writing by faxing them another letter doing so. \n\nI obviously know they received the fax now so I don't care to speak to them. Question is are they still obligated to send validation\/verification of the debt to the address I provided them in the letter as per the FDCPA? \n\nMy next step is to send letters to the 2 bureaus they are reporting to for erroneous information and that the debt is past the SOL and date for reporting to the credit file. When the bureaus request verification of the debts, will they also refuse to verify with them due to the cease and desist? I feel like they're pulling my leg here.\n\nI appreciate any advice. Thank you.\n","192":"I am helping my father repair his credit as much as possible and although I have a good understanding of how to approach dents owed by a collections agency, I'm unsure of whether the same rules apply to debts still owned by an original creditor, either being collected on by an internal collections department, contracted out to a collections agency but not sold, or not being collected on at all but just charged off. \n\nThere's about 6 or 7 accounts ranging from medical debt to credit cards and a personal loan that are charged off, some are being actively collected but some aren't.\n\nI'm not sure if I can even request validation of debt as some of these have even sent a collections letter. If they have never sent a bill or notice to collect can it even be disputed or demand validation? They just show up on the CRA report as a charge off. Are original creditor accounts subject to the same FCRA and FDCPA laws as collections agencies?\n\nLastly if I am disputing accounts as my father's agent with a power of attorney, can I watch a pay office or today's USPS box where I live and request correspondence be sent there? Or must correspondence be sent to the debtor only at the address on record? \n\nThank you","193":"I am helping my father repair good credit as much as possible and although I have a good understanding of how to approach dents owed by a collections agency, I'm unsure of whether the same rules apply to debts still owned by an original creditor, either being collected on by an internal collections department, contracted out to a collections agency but not sold, or not being collected on at all but just charged off. \n\nThere's about 6 or 7 accounts ranging from medical debt to credit cards and a personal loan that are charged off, some are being actively collected but some aren't.\n\nI'm not sure if I can even request validation of debt as some of these have even sent a collections letter.

This coincided with a loss of his job and being unemployed for a good while. That was 11 years ago but unfortunately, up until just last year, he was never able to get a job to which paid enough to keep him out of debt. \n\nNow, I am blessed to have very stable work, about 25k saved up and having seen my father's financial collapse, a very good sense of personal finance and frugality. I've also become one to always read the T&amp;C, laws and rules; which has been to my advantage many times. I'm ready to tackle trying ot repair his credit as much as we can. In the past 8 years my father has paid around 130k in rent that could have been put towards a mortgage were it not for his bad decisions and consequently crap credit; but our goal now that the situation is stable and he has a budget is to raise it enough to hopefully secure him a mortgage. He will turn 65 next year and will be able to pay a mortgage of up to $1400 with his SSI and pension.\n\nHere's what I have done so far:\n\n- Moved him out of an apartment where he was paying $1800 a month in rent which was over half his income. Now he is in an $1100 apartment.\n- Canceled \"toxic\" credit cards with crazy annual fees designed for people with bad credit and usually financed by tribes in South Dakota\n- Applied him for 2 secured credit cards with a low balance that will be used for his monthly recurrent bills and (as I have done since moving out) be paid every single month, never paying interest or late. Hopefully this will establish good history and raise his score.\n- Gathered all of his financial documents to get a picture of what's going on - I have all the collections notices he has received so I can get started challenging them.\n- Received a durable and extensive power of attorney as required by state law so I can represent him when speaking to creditors, collections agencies etc.\n- He was previously paying for credit repair services until I told him I can do the same thing for free. They were actually able to remove quite a bit of things from his reports.\n\nThe question is how I get started. A lot of these are a couple years old, in the past couple years his situation got better and the defaults stopped. Since these are every old, can they still be requested to be verified? In total there's about 15k in defaulted accounts of various types. About 6k is from a loan and credit card he used to have with a credit union, and about another 6k is medical debt from when he was hospitalized prior to when he had health insurance. The other varies from past due accounts, a payday loan, a cell phone account, etc.\n\nI'd like to negotiate pay for deletes for almost all of these accounts. Would I tackle it the same way as I would new debt that just recently sent a collection notice by sending a certified letter denying responsibility and acknowledgement of the debt? Or is there a time limit on this?\n\nI appreciate any help you can give.

Pretty much only states procedures for eviction and deposit payment.\n\nAnyway I'm rambling and that's beside the point. The question is: is there anything that can obligate this landlord to fix anything, clean anything or do anything? Or does my father just have to fix the apartment up himself or accept living with all these issues? I love Florida but its in ancient history regarding tenant protection.

Specifically for MST","199":"Good evening. I am humbly posting here to ask you all for your help as there not much else I can do at this point but leave it to God.\n\nMy father is dealing with years of financial struggle and crisis and this year I was able to convince him to find a unit with a lower rent to get him back on his feet. He can't afford where he is at anymore. I busted my ass and looked and looked for a week straight, making phone calls, sending emails, etc. In the end only one place has even looked at his application. It was all going well until they attempted to contact the current leasing company which refuses to provide a reference without Frost giving notice to vacate.\n\nSo now I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place trying to decide whether to give notice to vacate at the old unit to get a (hopefully good) reference for the new unit or just play it safe and stay put. I have such a higher fear of doing that and the new company not accepting the application, making my father and teenage sister effectively homeless. I feel so defeated and it off energy that after I did so much and worked so hard, ignored my wife for days, Working to find a unit and believing this one was it, were hung up on such a small issue. I'm even offering much of my savings to pay 3 months up front however I still don't know what the outcome will be. On top of everything else, with the shutdown I have no idea when I will be paid or if the Coast Guard will be funded any time soon.\n\nI ask you to please pray to God that he can illuminate the mind of the person in charge of the new unit to offer my father a lease tomorrow. We really need this in our life right now. Please Lord, I beg of you to bless us with this unit and convince this gentleman to offer us the lease. I say and write this with tears running down my face, please pray for us tonight. ","200":"I started contributing into TSP this year and contributed about 2700 over the year.

Only issue it has is that the damn fuel gauge sucks. If I fill it up it will correctly show a full tank. Then it will be random in what it shows each time I drive it. It will go down to like half a tank and then I'll park for one hour for groceries, come back and it will be on E  with the gas light on. I'll drive it 5 minutes and it will go back up to half tank by itself .\n\nSometimes I'll start it in the morning, it will show half tank, I'll be on the highway and it will run out of gas and shut off with the gauge showing half tank the whole time, even after it's dead on the road. Putting in gas always solves the issue so I know it's running out of fuel not another engine problem.\n\nThe gas sending unit on this vehicle is attached to the fuel pump. I'm wondering if replacing the pump and sending unit would possibly solve the issue. Some of my friends say it could be electrical in which case I have no idea how to tackle the issue. I've been stranded on the highway and had to be bailed out by friends, tow trucks and state troopers like 5 rimes. I'm done with it.

CG has been more liberal in the sense that PCS is still going on with restrictions, etc. A good call IMO as so many people had their PCS plans set. DoD also continues to have a stop movement in place which is allowing, as I understand it, almost no travel. I may be wrong though. It's set to expire at the end of June. \n\nNow that CG has revised travel policy to allow domestic leave anywhere in the U.S. with approval from first O-6 in the chain, what bets are we putting down for when foreign travel leave may be allowed again? - assuming some crazy event doesn't take place which leads to more restrictions. I'm trying to figure out if its worth waiting for policy to be revised or just let my family travel without me if this will be ops normal for a long time to come.","228":"The past week or so I've started to become extremely depressed and angry seeing all of the ridiculous things going on. Not the fact that people are protesting - it's always been a thing and it's people's right to protest. Rather seeing all the looting and destruction and people cheering it on at all levels and all through this website. I rally started to wonder if I am losing my mind or if the entire rest of the world is crazy. Add to that seeing the videos of some police acting as much as thugs as the rioters. The straw that breaks the camels back is seeing how monuments in D.C. got desecrated, and even in military subs seeing people calling police pigs and pokers, and straight up calling for NG troops to fight it out with police officers.\n\nNow none of this stuff is a big deal honestly. What drives me nuts is the fact that any dissenting opinion is quickly shut down, ridiculed, and any argument is shut down by just writing \"racist\". You literally cannot have a conversation anymore on a website that is *meant for conversation* because no discourse is allowed anymore. Only the leftist narrative is allowed by *design* on this website. Starting with the voting system that is obviously (not even trying to hide it anymore) controlled by bots rather than 1 user 1 vote. Then deleting posts and banning users who say something against the narrative. Again, what really blew my mind was this happening on military subs - I know the politics and every other default sub does that shit. \n\nIts just constantly being berated by the same unopposed idea that gets more and more ridiculous every fucking day. I expect in a short itme we'll have people on this website calling for the torching of governmental building or placement of car bombs or sniping of public officials and they'll be upvoted to the top, no opposition, all dissenting posts deleted and banned. \n\nThen I started to wonder why I'm trying to \"save\" this website. Why am I expending so much energy trying to \"change the bad boy\" if you will when its obvious that the problem is not the userbase, this comes from the very top - from the administration and in many cases mods. A website owned by Chinese interests, whom has filled the site with Chinese agents, helped them drown out the opposing voices through the use of bots. Most of this website isn't even American at this point. Yet you have all these people posting on U.S. topics and shitting on the U.S. in the process. Just take a look at my recent posts on the USA sub this morning (which laughably is full of mostly non-Americans and almost all the things posted on there on a normal day is shitting on the U.S. one way or another). The system is rigged an no amount of arguing with people will change it.\n\nHowever, as a whole Reddit is still useful to meet others who share a hobby or a interest. I originally came to this website to talk about and post about anime figures and anime. Now I also like the cooking and food subs. I enjoy learning gardening and fishing skills on here and I enjoy the discussion on the investing subs. These subs are almost all devoid of any political BS of either side of the aisle. which is refreshing. I don't have a problem with people having an opposing political view (excepting nazis and commies, fuck nazis and commies) I went through and unsubbed from all subs which have become infected with the leftism-above-all virus over hte years. When I first subbed to these communities, they were either apolitical or fair in political discussion. Now that's no longer the case there's no point in being there. I use adblockers to prevent this website from getting any money from me. Hopefully ruqqus can gain traction (seeing as voat has shifted too far to the extreme right). I use the donald win website if I want to read things regarding the 2020 campaign. It's absolutely refreshing to go down my feed and not be bombarded with bullshit left and right. I've done the same on Facebook deleting old acquaintances who aren't capable of respecting the fact that I have a different opinion from them. \n\nAt first I worried about doing the same as the left by \"shutting out\" opposing views - that I might become too engrained in my own echo chamber where I never hear anything of the opposing side. However the fact is all mainstream forms of media and telecommunications has become synonymous with the far-left - just by existing within the U.S. and using U.S. media I am exposed to the far-left narrative whether I want to or not. I don't need to actively subscribe to and consume their media. Rather I need to make an effort to support and patronize publications and media that still write based on fact and logic rather than the manifesto. I've subscribed to the Epoch times, I've subscribed to conservative and centrist youtubers and tweeters. I'm shutting out all of the left from my life - just as they do to me and others who think as I do. The left needs to be commended for two things: \n\n1. their patience and persistence. They will never stop no matter how hard the going gets for them at a point in history.\n2. Their enviable ability to successfully, shamelessly and aggressively organize into their own groups and shut out opinions that are dangerous to their narrative and which would destroy their movement form within. Unless the center and the right is ready to do the same, they will never win the \"battle\". If we don't patronize what's left of websites, media, authors, actors, civil servants, forums, and social media that still have common sense and honesty, they will be wiped out before you know it and there will only be one opinion, one station, one channel, one party, one website approved, allowed and available. Just look at what happened ears ago on \/r\/christianity. It used to be pretty good and full of mainstream Christians. Then it became about shitting on mainstream Christianity because the mods and the userbase allowed atheists and anti-Christians (Not that I have an issue with either - they just don't belong in a Christian forum just as homophobes don't belong on an LGBT forum) to have a voice and say whatever they wanted in the name of \"tolerance\" until the point where they had to make another sub and call it truechristian. When you give the far-left a voice in a group they will take your inch and then take a mile.  \n\nThe fact is most people, including liberals\/leftists do not agree with the way things are going down. The fact is a significantly larger number of people from all backgrounds have, do and are beginning to agree with the centrist and conservative viewpoint - but are too afraid to be vocal about it due to fear of being killed symbolically and in extreme cases literally. The silent majority if you will. The left seems like they are in the majority and in control of everything because they hoot and holler and cry the loudest. But volume does not equal quantity. One thousand people saying one thing in a whisper is more powerful than 100 people screaming another thing at the top of their lungs.","229":"[removed]","230":"The type sold as big y and Walmart and BJ's and made by TNT.\n\nI googled and looked in municode and the information is contradictory.

I have a question regarding my father's policy and wanted to check with people here whom are more knowledgeable than I about the subject. We have of course spoken to his agent who took the time to explain and make me understand better than I did before, but still I want to get a third party opinion. I know there's a number of opinions regarding whether or not permanent life insurance policies are good \"investment vehicles\" in the long run and how, especially for a younger person with a standard\/common situation, your money is better used elsewhere such as an IRA, etc; but please keep the conversation on topic with the questions I have regarding the policy rather than recommend how he'd be \"better of\" doing X Y or Z rather than keeping this policy. My father has made it very clear he will continue to pay for some type of life insurance policy, I just want to make sure this one is viable. \n\nBack when he was 47 years old, my father took out a 15 year term policy with a $500,000 death benefit. It was relatively cheap at about 80 dollars a month or something around that amount. It expired two years ago at age 62.\n\nHe feels that \n1. Life insurance is the only way he would be able to leave behind some sort of inheritance as he has no assets\n2. He might as well get something out of the insurance as he's already \"paid into it\" for 15 years. I don't particularly agree but whatever, its his policy, not mine. \n\nHis agent recommended using the conversion clause in the term policy to convert the previous term policy into a new IUL policy with the same company. This allowed him to remain in the preferred category without a medical exam as he now has hypertension, diabetes and is taking medication for both.\n\nAt the time of the policy purchase the thing my father stressed on was a policy in which the premiums would never rise and would remain level throughout the life of the policy. I read through the policy and the attached policy illustration which is what left me confused. The policy illustration shows an Annualized Premium Outlay of $5,556 per year ($463 monthly), which indicates a level premium for the life of the policy regardless of age. This is in line with what he searched for in the new policy as the premium would never change. \n\nHowever, when reviewing the policy contract, I get the impression that eventually the Cost of Insurance will surpass the $463 monthly premium due to age. **Here's the thing: I don't KNOW if I am calculating the monthly cost of insurance correctly, I may not be.** Here's how I'm seeing it though:\n\nThe Table of Guaranteed Cost of Insurance Rates for age 64 shows 1.17 per $1,000 of the Net Amount of Risk (250). Therefore if we multiply 1.17 by 250, we get a monthly cost of insurance of $292.5 . At this time, this is fine because the monthly premium of $463 is larger than the monthly cost of insurance with a leftover balance of $170.5 per month which I assume goes into the fixed or indexed account value of the policy. However, at age 70, the Table of Guaranteed Cost of Insurance Rates shows 2.03. If we multiply 2.03 by 250, we get a monthly cost of insurance of $507.5 which is greater than the monthly premium of $463. In other words, if we continue to pay only $463 per month at that age, each month the policy will need to use $44.5 of the cash value to cover the Cost of Insurance, which will eventually deplete the entire cash value. The problem comes once the Cost of Insurance is too high to pay, for example, at age 80,  the Table of Guaranteed Cost of Insurance Rates shows 5.84. If we multiply 5.84 by 250, we get a monthly cost of insurance of $1,460 which is of course unaffordable. By the same calculation, the monthly cost of insurance at age 99 is $8,525. \n\nAm I understanding the policy incorrectly? If the Cost of Insurance each year remains constant, the current premium of $463 would continue to cover the cost for the life of the policy. However, if it rises each year, eventually it will outpace this premium amount. I understand that the No Lapse Guarantee Premium of $385.63 monthly prevents lapse of the policy so long as that amount is paid each month, however that No Lapse Guarantee period ends on the 10th anniversary of the policy. I don't see in the policy where premiums are guaranteed to remain level at the $463 level for the life of the policy, only in the policy illustration which is not part of the policy contract. \n\nWhat I understood from the agent when he explained is that because in the first 8 or so years of the policy, there is a surplus of money paid into the policy\/account as we are paying a premium higher than the cost of insurance, that excess will go into the cash value of the account and of course generate at least the guaranteed interest of 2.5% per year (possibly more depending on the the index performance). Therefore, when the cost of insurance is higher than what the $463 monthly can cover, the cash value of the account will be used to cover the gap and keep the policy alive until age 100, at which point no more premiums are paid and the policy remains in effect until age 120. He did **stress** that the plan\/formula\/illustration ONLY worked if the $463 premiums were paid as planned. No paying for a month or paying less than normal or paying just the no-lapse premium would of course change the whole thing and possibly mess it up, shortening the life of the policy and causing a danger of lapse.\n\nWe're fine with paying the $463 monthly, and in the \"worst\" case where my father makes it to 100, we would have put in around $211,000 dollars so at the very least we'd get $40,000 out of it, ignoring the opportunity cost\/inflation etc. However, I need to be sure that when my father reaches age 80 or 85 or 90, the company won't tell me the planned premium isn't enough to cover the cost and I need to cough up more cash after I'm already really invested in the thing. The agent said he is getting some up to date illustrations\/reports from the insurer to show how the account would grow\/perform until age 100, which makes me feel more secure as I know a national, legit insurance company won't make up BS numbers to trick people. Everything I am reading online shows that although Whole Life policies have a level premium for the life of the policy, Universal Life policies have variable premiums. However, if what the agent is saying is accurate, then I have no problem with the policy. \n\nLastly, this is probably a question more appropriate for the insurer\/agent because it's probably in the policy somewhere, but in general with IUL\/UL policies, in the event f the insured's death, does the death benefit include the net cash value of the policy (if any) in addition to the $250,000 death specified amount, or only the $250,000 specified amount?\n\nI apologize for the long post however getting some clarification would be very helpful. I appreciate your help and your time.","267":"[removed]","268":"This a-hole at my parent's apartment complex whom is supposed to monitor parking has it out for them, and has gotten to the point of removing their parking permit so he can place a tow sticker on it for not having a permit.

I have decide to write this post as a public announcement due to the influx of posts recently from people who are intending on joining the service. A while ago I suggested to the mods that we create a weekly sticky or something for joining questions but they didn't agree and I think its because they would like this sub to be a place where people can come an ask reasonable questions and search for information without being limited to a single post deep in a sticky where it will have less exposure. I appreciate that and it definitely has its upside compared to other service's subs.\n\n I will start this post by saying my exposure to the CG is limited as I am a non-rate with one year in service and I can and will only tell you what I have the ability to say because speaking out of our hypothetical behind about things we do not know about is not useful for anyone. Keep this in mind when gathering information. If a non rate who has spent 2 years cleaning bilges is trying to tell you what a chief or an officer does or how things are in levels they have not achieved, take that with a grain of salt. Get information from a credible source.\n\n**Before Posting**\n\n-  Success in the Coast Guard, and likely in life, depends on your ability to be self-sufficient and do your own homework. You cannot expect others to put in the footwork for you when it comes to information. If you come in here and ask what the rates in the CG are, or how much an E-3 gets paid a month, you will get flak because you can easily go on gocoastguard.com and find this info and more. Before asking a question, do your best to research, google is your friend. uscg.mil and gocoastguard.com are the official websites for info. Once you have done this, feel free to ask about anything you don't understand or something you want to know in more detail. If you join you will have to do your own studying for quals and advancement, you will need to do your own research regarding benefits etc, you will be responsible for learning the responsibilities of your job yourself. When you go to the yeoman, you can bet your ass it will be \"member responsibility\" to fill out your own shit. People can help you but nobody will do it for you.\n\n- Your best resource with anything related to your entry into the service is your recruiter. They are specifically trained to know the official ins and outs of everything related to joining, the service, and your eligibility. People here joined in the past, when policies might have been different, when bonuses were higher or lower, when the CG was accepting nobody or when it was giving out bonuses for joining.Only your recruiter has access to internal information from Recruiting Command that nobody else in the service does; all so they can tell you how it is. Do not lie to your recruiter. It is a federal offense, while it likely won't land you in the brig, it can and many times will result in a negative discharge depending on the severity of the lie. You don't need and should not volunteer information that has not been asked of you (ie don't waste his time and yours telling him about the one time you had a weird cough when you were 5 years old and so does that mean you can't join because what if you have asthma even though you have never been diagnosed with asthma and nobody even asked you about this at all) , don't make things complicated for your recruiter; but if you have been specifically asked \"have you taken illegal narcotics\" and you lie, you are doing yourself a wrong, and you have no integrity, and it will bite you in the ass. \n\n**When Posting**\n\n- The most important thing when posting is understanding that nobody cares about your life story. Sorry to be blunt. Everyone in the service, and in the world has a story. The biggest violators of this are college kids. Look, regardless of how much they glorified college for your as a kid, its not that huge of a deal. Many people go to college, including many people who enlist. There are even a significant amount of people enlisted in all branches with masters and education that probably trump yours by a long shot. So please don't start your post with the following template:\n\n\"Hi guys I am in my 4th year of whatevertheheck studies at Bro State University I want to be a firefighter\/cop\/Krusty Krab frycook you guys are so cool and heroes and I saw the Guardian and I'm ready to save lives and travel the world and shoot big guns and have adventures....\"\n\n- You should write things that are pertinent to your question, joining, or the service. Its great that you have dreams and goals and all that but it doesn't really affect your enlistment. Its cool you want to travel the world but the CG isn't about going on a global cruise, its about doing a job. Write your basic info, what you have researched, what your specific, detailed question is, and press submit. Don't put a whole bunch of extra emotional stuff in your post that isn't necessary.\n\n- The CG is not here for you, this isn't about you, and its not going to mold itself to your dreams and hopes and wants. The CG will be here whether or not you join. Therefore understand that you can't choose your first duty station, you can't choose to be in a cutter or land unit, you can't choose fireman vs seaman. You can choose to enlist or not. you can make a dream sheet that might be considered, that's it. You might be able to put a guaranteed district in your contract if your recruiter offers it. The Coast Guard will provide you compensation for your service, sustenance, a place to live for you and your family, health insurance, and legal representation, all in accordance with policies and laws set forth by the government. You provide your service with a good attitude, devotion to duty, and do what you are told, when you are told, within the scopes of (Coast Guard) logic.  It's like a [mutualistic, facultative, symbiotic relationship](http:\/\/www.biology-online.org\/dictionary\/Facultative_mutualism) where the government holds up its end of the deal, and you hold up yours. I personally believe anyone who accepts this and puts forth the effort in the CG can be successful. \n\n**Boot Camp**\n\n- Basic training, or \"recruit training\" is not pleasant. I don't care if your uncle Billy Bob was in the Army and he said USCG training is a 2 month tea party. It is not. You get yelled at all day every day, you have to do bodyweight exercise all day every day, you talk, walk and eat like a robot, you are treated like a stupid child, you're scared of being in trouble every minute, and it seems to last forever. That being said its not a huge deal. If you are in good physical condition, keep your mouth shut and are not stupid you will pass training. When I was there is was the hardest thing in the world, a year later I realized (this is my personal opinion) it was frankly a waste of my time and I learned very little to help me in my real CG job. It's like a bad episode of survivor. Some people who were less mature than me definitely benefited from it because it taught them how to get up in the morning, make a bed, put on a good looking uniform and follow orders. I didn't have trouble with any of that so it now seems pointless; but everyone needs to go through it and if you maintain a positive attitude and can shut your mind off for 8 weeks you will be fine.\n\nThat's about all I have to say. The main thing to take away is do your own research, ask your recruiter, don't lie, keep posts simple and related to the question, stop freaking out about boot camp and don't join if you can't accept the government telling you where to live, how to live and what to do at work for the next 4 years. Feel free to ask me any questions and I will answer them if I am qualified to do so.","301":"[removed]","302":"[removed]","303":"[removed]","304":"[removed]","305":"[removed]","306":"","307":"","308":"","309":"","310":"Hello everyone and thank you for reading.

I was dumb at the time and was told I needed to buy a car that week by my command so I went to the Toyota dealership and bought it for about 8k with a 2.3 apr loan from Navy Federal credit Union. Still owe 5k on it. The model is worth about 3k on Craiglist.\n\nI'm getting married soon with my fiance from overseas and then I'm due for a PCS. So not a great time. However I have 11k in the bank between checking and savings accounts. I was hoping to have 10k in saving before getting married but I guess I have to bite the bullet. \n\nI estimate an engine change including labor will run me 3k-3.5k dollars. I hope to get some sort of warranty with it but I don't know how that works. Or I could junk this car, pay off they loan or roll it into another loan to buy another car. In that case should I go used again, or should I lease? Not sure what to do. Also depending where we are stationed we might get my wife a car for her to move around and commute. I'm an event of buying new and getting 20k in debt although she thinks it's worth it to avoid issues.\n\nSo my 4 options:\n\n1. Replace engine for 3-3.5k\n2. Junk car and pay off loan, buy another used car.\n3. Roll over loan into buying a buy more expensive used car\n4. Pay off loan and Lease a car.\n\nCurrent debt:\n\n1. 30k Federal student loans planning to pay with pslf.\n2. Car loan of 5k\n No other debt.\n\nCurrent assets:\n11k in liquid bank accounts\n4k in roth tsp\nFiance will bring another 5k in cash\n\nI appreciate any advice on the best way to go about solving this problem.

I work with mechanics in the military and it's 50\/50 what they're telling me regarding whether my engine is fried or if I got lucky.\n\nI haven't really had any trouble with my engine it car, always keep up with maintainance. Last oil change was about 3 months ago , I put in synthetic mobil oil . \n\nI didn't notice at the time but after I got stranded and got home I saw there was a couple small oil stains in my driveway that weren't there the week before maybe. \n\nAnyways what happened was I was driving up hill from my station towards San Francisco and heard a loud pop, not extreme like a bang but as if I had popped a can under the car. I chalked it off as running over some debris and kept going. \n\nThe traffic on the bridge was stopped up so it was stop and go for about 5-10 minutes, didn't go over 25 mph. After a couple minutes I began to hear slight noise though it took a little while before I realized it was coming from my car and not a car next to me. I didn't have space to pull over so I got out on the next exit making sure to not accelerate more than like 1.5k RPM. \n\nWhen I parked my car I noticed my engine oil I ight was on, don't know how long. Turned off the engine, Took a look under the car and saw oil pouring out very quickly and realized I'd need a tow. \n\nI estimate about 1-1.5 quarts of oil continued to drain out over the course of 3-4 minutes on to the road. It came to a drip after that. My coolant was not steaming, engine was not visibly over heated and no smoke. I didn't hear any strong knocking or grating, just the go kart noise during acceleration. \n\nGot a tow and jacked it up at home to find my plug was missing. Not sure if the threads are good or not. There was no oil above the drain and when I poured in a quart of oil it poured out of only the oil drain. So I'm about 95% sure that's the issue. \n\nSo here come the questions. I have no idea why my plug came off or flew off months after my last oil change. I don't see another oil leaks, so imagine the fix of the leak is simple, buy a drain plug and plug it, pour in new oil and filter. I'll do that Monday once I'm off duty. \n\nThe question is how likely it is that I destroyed my engine. Many people are telling me it's fucked, anything over a minute with low oil is a goner. I'm keeping a little sliver of hope that since I still had oil pouring out after parking maybe it was low enough to run roughly but not too low to grind out the engine. I guess I'll find it once I crank that key after the oil change. What do you all think will probably happen to the engine?\n\nAny special precautions I should take before I start her up again? Or thing I should look out or listen for afterwards if it works? Should I pull out the oil pan to inspect the oil and pan for shavings?\n\nFinally if the engine is fried, where do I go from here? Would you recommend putting in another engine instead of buying another car? I still owe 5k on it... If so where do people get reliable engines and do any of them come with any sort of warranty? \n\nI'm very lost on this and it's happening at a bad time as my fiance immigrates to the us in 2 weeks and then I'm up for a PCS possibly cross country.

I got a sort of unique issue and thought it be worth a shot posting online and seeing what opportunities arise.\n\nSome background. I'm the son of immigrant parents from Latin America. My father was a military officer in his home country and still recieves a pension from the military there.  He works in a tourism company and has for about 4 years. \n\nBack when the economy was very good and there was more opportunity for them, my parents owned a cleaning company, made good money, as well as worked dayjobs. Unfortunately due to bad financial decisions in 2008 (purchased a property and refinanced their home right before the crash), they lost their home in 2008. Father also lost his job and the company went under.\n\nMy parents then rented various houses and apartments ranging from 1400-2000 dollars a month.  Unfortunately when at the high end of the spectrum his income was not high enough to cover all his expenses and he relied on credit to pay the bills until he got the steady job he has now.  This left his credit a mess and it's rightfully his fault. \n\nAfter some financial advising I was able to get him he's slowly started to recover economically, but the huge thorn in the side is the price of rent. The apartment he's been in for the last 3 years costs 1775 a month and continues to rise yearly. \nTo make things worse my mother decided to sperate and now lives in another city as a live in maid so it's on his income only. Due to this I have had to supplement him with some extra money for rent once in a while.\n\nI have calculated that for him to have a stable budget his rent should be no more than 1200-1300 a month.  \n\nI posted on the Orlando subreddit as it's where he lives to see if maybe any people there are looking for tenants but I'm not sure if that lead to much lol. \n\nThe biggest difficulty I'm having is in finding a 2 or 3 bedroom home for that price which isn't in the ghetto. I haven't in loved in Florida for 3 years since in stained out of state but I can't believe that rent would have gone up so damn much that it's impossible to find a relatively safe place for less than 2000 a month. Am I wrong about that? Hopefully Florida isn't turning into California is terms of rent. \n\nI'm even willing to cosign as a guarantor since his credit is shot but I keep having trouble finding places within price range. Rented always been a nightmare for us and a lot of applications go into the black hole and cost like 50 dollars per person so it's like to go for realistic stuff rather than apply in every complex that accepts an application fee.\n\nAnyways if you read up to here I greatly appreciate your time and even some advice is appreciated as well. \n\nThanks","337":"Hello everyone.

Last year I hit a big pothole and my right front tire blew up. I put a cheapo Chinese tire on it and forgot about it. Recently I have been a vibration above 55-60 mph and decided on getting a set of new good tires. However I'm saving up for a couple months and thought a rotation and balance might help In the meantime. \n\nWhen the mechanic pulled the wheels off to balance he said the room if the wheel that blew was bent and showed me.

I appreciate any help you can give.","352":"I've written about my situation a bit before but I wanted to make a post about it to see if I could get some advice. I'm a confirmed Catholic, and I am stationed in California away from my original state of Florida, where all my family and friends live. \n\nA number of years ago in university I met the woman who is now my fiance, an exchange student from Japan. She is a wonderful woman, very well raised and interested in starting and nurturing a home. She is spiritual and believes in existence of a God, but she is not Christian, as are most Japanese. Against all odds we have been able to maintain a strong relationship for years and want to be married and start a family here in the U.S.\n\nAs she will have to use a fiance visa to enter the U.S., I am already dealing with the expected bureaucracy of the government in requesting her visa. What I did not expect is to find a similar issue in the church.\n\nI want to be married in the church because I believe it is the logical and dutiful thing to do as a Catholic. I am lucky enough that she does not oppose to the idea, and it is enough that she has agreed to allow me to raise the children Catholic as the church requires. But it seems that actually getting married is such a lengthy and complex process that it is discouraging. \n\nAs there is a disparity of cult, I need to request a dispensation from a bishop. Fair enough. I would also like to get married in Florida where my family and my friends are, as I know nobody here other than others at my unit whom I don't really feel need to be at my wedding. So I attempt to contact priests that worked at the parishes in Florida that I attended. None of them answer my emails, calling the parish only gets me a layperson (there seem to be a lot of them and no clergy in the church anymore) who can't help me. I guess the next step is to talk to the priest at the local parish where I live, but I am not actually a registered member of the parish, nor do I participate in the community. I go to mass when I can and leave after it is finished. I have no connection to the parish or priest and am afraid they will not go out of the way to accommodate my issues; there are a number of things that must be done for us to be able to marry:\n\n- Receive a dispensation for disparity of cult\n- Sign statements\/swear that the children will be raised Catholic, etc. More than likely she will be grilled on her responsibilities of the marriage as a non-Catholic, we will be asked multiple times if we are sure, etc.\n- Request permission from a parish in Florida to marry us, someone outside of their parish\n- Attend pre-marriage classes in the local area\n- The parish\/disocese here must communicate with the parish\/diocese there about classes, dispensation, etc etc\n- I must figure out a way to receive a newly certified copy of my baptismal certificate no more than 6 months old from a town in Colombia in South America that uses practically no electronic communication, and, knowing Colombia, will expect me to fly over there to request this certificate; even though I have my ORIGINAL certificate on-hand\n- I must explain to the priest why she and I will be living together prior to marriage (she is coming from another country and has nowhere to stay), why we are already married civilly (the visa requires it and we get no family benefits from the Coast Guard if we are not married) \n\nI am not looking for a fancy wedding, I don't want it to be big or lavish. In fact I want it to be simple, unexpensive, with only my parents and in-laws, some family and a couple friends there. I could take the easy way out and get married at one of the ultra-liberal protestant churches here in SF bay that will marry anyone with a pulse or at a place that looks like a church and has some priest-look alike but I don't want to because I am Catholic and I want to be married in the church to which I belong. \n\nYet it seems like it may be an uphill battle to actually have a Catholic wedding. I don't understand why there is so much red tape and a checklist to do something that is a natural part of life. Pope Francis married a couple on a plane in an hour and yet parishes require applications and a year of planning. I speak to my family about how they married 40, 50 or 60 years ago in Colombia and it was nothing more than simple ceremonies in some farm town taking no more than an hour or two. In fact my uncle ran away with his girlfriend one day and was married by a priest the next town over 2 days later because he didn't want his father to get in his way. I don't see requirements in canon law for applications or pre-cana classes or any of the other fluff. It seems the church is straying farther from traditional marriage and more into the bureaucratic-like marriages officiated by governments. The church spends a lot of time \"defending traditional marriage\" yet makes it so complicated to partake in traditional marriage. \n\nI'm just ranting on at this point and I'm sorry for doing so. I don't know where I should speak to a local priest or maybe contact one of the Navy chaplains to try and get this ball rolling. I would really like for my wedding to become a reality. Advice is greatly appreciated.","353":"Hello everyone. Thought this would be a good place to ask for any recent couples who succesfully did the process. I'm petitioning for a K-1 visa for my fiance in Japan, and although I wanted to apply back in September she was stubborn and wanted to wait until January so she could \"get her things in order\". we were planning on a 6 month processing time and hopefully arriving in September 2018. Now its January and I look a the processing times and supposedly they are just now working on July 2017 applications! So according to that pace, if I apply now the visa might not be approved until next year. Is that about correct right now?\n\nI don't mind the wait too much but the issue is I am active duty military and am supposed to receive new orders next January. If she isn't here by then it could make things a lot harder for me. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated.","354":"","355":"Hello everyone. I will be visiting my fiance who lives in Osaka, but have come to realize that while tickets to Osaka are in the 1500-2500 dollar range which is pretty ridiculous, flights to Tokyo are easily found at 500-800 dollars. \n\nI am interested in flying into Tokyo and then taking a domestic flight on jetstar or peach or something to Osaka. In the US buying a ticket the day of is basically a death sentence in terms of cost but is it the same in Japan? I looked up the price of a flight on December 30 and it was only about 100 dollars one way.\n\nAlso, if you are over the weight\/bag number limit can you just pay a fee and take them with you or is it simply not allowed on board?\n\nThank you","356":"I'm asking more for my father than myself, but I come from a Colombian family, and my uncle started his own coffee company in Colombia a couple years ago. He has had success there and other Latin American countries. My father has wanted to try selling the coffee in the US using Amazon or eBay but can't see to understand when I tell him it will most likely not sell without people knowing what it is, as people buy what they have heard of\/see commercials for\/see highly rated on yelp etc.\n\nUnfortunately most coffee communities I have found including here on reddit they understandably prohibit self promotion unless you are actively discussing in those communities. I have tried the coffee myself and its pretty damn good but I don't see how anyone would buy a coffee they've never heard of. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated.","357":"Earlier this year I submitted a PSLF employer certification form which caused my loans to be transferred to Fedloan who currently services my loans. They sent me notice stating I had to recertify for REPAYE so I sent in the form. \n\nFedloan sent me a letter stating it had been received and processed, and in fact my payment went down to 10 bucks (way too low IMO)\n\nHowever, Nelnet also sent me a notice which is attached here: https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/On0DYxE.png\n\nObviously they don't have these loans anymore, but should I do anything to inform them they no longer service the loans? I wouldn't want this to adversely affect my PSLF later on.","358":"Father is a Hispanic senior over 40 who works at a mid size business as a courier. He has had his this position for 4 years. He was originally hired to complete a set route in 8 hours and is the oldest individual there aside from the owners.  There is another person who is the only other courier that is treated very differently from him although they have the same position. About a year ago they doubled my fathers workload by doubling the amount of stops he makes and expect him to complete it in 4 hours, whilst promising they would \u201ccontinue to pay him 8 hours\u201d. They also expected him to work 7 days a week with no overtime pay. As the route is impossible to complete in 4 hours, especially without speeding against the law, he has done his best but usually does not make it in 4 hours. On some days, he is asked to make extra stops or return to a previous stop which causes him to work over 8 hours, although he is never paid overtime, regardless of the hours he works. Unfortunately there is no check in\/out system at the business to monitor work hours so I\u2019m not sure he can really make a case about overtime pay. \n\nAll this would passable as a part of the job however there is other actions by the employer that I don\u2019t find very acceptable. When requesting his one week of paid vacation he was given a single week in the year that he is allowed to take leave while everyone else is for the most part able to request the date they would like. Other workers receive perks from the company such as gift cards, event tickets, and other prizes while he receives none.  When he is sick or needs a day off for an extenuating circumstance, he is always rejected yet when the other courier takes a day off my father is told to complete both routes (his and the other couriers). \n\nRecently the company promoted an employee to work at the office in weekends when the regular managers are off. This individual harassed my father via phone and text since the morning warning him he must be done before 4 hours; he called my father and called him inept, incompetent, senile, and that other workers would probably be able to do the route faster than him. My father did not answer any more calls from him as he was only calling to harass and insult him which slowed him down . The next day he informed the other managers of this issue although rather than mediate or tell the other employee to not insult my father, they suspended my father for three days without pay as punishment. At this moment it is not known if they will fire him but the question if it would be viable to pursue a lawsuit in this case and how we could find a lawyer , hopefully Spanish speaking that would be interested in taking this case.

I don't live with my parents anymore.\n\nMy parents moved to the US when I was young, my sister was born, they busted their ass to get ahead, had a good family and everything was great up until like 4 or 5 years ago when my mother started to change. First sign of trouble was when she was caught being flirtatious over the phone with some guy in Europe. Parents had a big fight and she promised to never do it again. Years later, she told my father out of the blue she doesn't love him any more. They just sort of ignored it. Some months after that, I saw flirtatious messages between her and the same guy from before but I just kept my mouth shut because I was a kid and was scared what could happen.\n\n\nFast forward to 3 or 4 years ago and she starts treating my father like shit. Criticizes everything he does, kicks him out of the bedroom so he has to sleep in my sister's bed. Doesn't allow him to touch her, hug her, kiss her, or anything else. Only talks to him to ask for money or complain about money. Goes on multiple trips a year and spends money she doesn't have to do it.  This year there was a large fallout of all this when she asked my sister who she would stay with if she left my father, and my sister responded \"with dad\". She's negative about everything, hates everything, only seems to sort of get along with me. Doesn't pay any bills. Takes every possible chance to talk shit about my father. Doesn't cook or clean anymore, even for my minor sister. Doesn't go to her school activities and barely talks to her. And now she's apparently going to move out, leave the two behind and become a nanny for an autistic child or something.\n\nObviously, the marriage\/home is irreparably damaged. And although my father is too much of a pansy to accept this, anyone can probably tell there's no going back. My question is why. How does a woman married for over 15 years suddenly do a 180 and become an insufferable B*** and hate her husband to the bone? What triggers this crazy \"walkaway wife syndrome\"? Sometimes, I honestly believe she is just mentally insane. I see no other explanation to why someone would just self destruct everything they know as she has.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: \n\nAfter like 15 years, mother flirst with some guy online, starts to hate my father, becomes a b*** about everything and doesn't cook or clean anymore, spends money she doesn't have on trips abroad, ignores my underage sister, doesn't contribute financially to the family, and has completely self-destructed over absolutely no apparent reason.

Stinging in the anus  after pooping, a little pressure in the anus and sometimes itching. A little bit of bright red blood when wiping. However  the issue was not fixed with antibiotics. The only symptoms I'm having now is the hemorroids type that I just mentioned and a pinch in the urethra right behind the scrotum around where the Cowper's gland is that I mainly feel when sitting or standing up from a seat or a little when pooping. \n\nOriginally I chalked this pinch to be a pelvic floor muscular issue which frequently gets misdiagnosed as Prostatitis and is easily fixed with stretching, particularly because I have a little of glute muscle tightness that may be pushing on my pudendal nerve , but the blood when wiping has me thinking.\n\nAm going to right to be concerned? I'm in a tough spot right now because this started happening right before I headed off to a 16 week school in the military where I'll be a little limited in what I can do and I don't really want to stir the pot.
